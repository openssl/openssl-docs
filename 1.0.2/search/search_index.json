This allows all the problems with a certificate chain to be determined.</p> <p>The verify operation consists of a number of separate steps.</p> <p>Firstly a certificate chain is built up starting from the supplied certificate and ending in the root CA. It is an error if the whole chain cannot be built up. The chain is built up by looking up the issuers certificate of the current certificate. If a certificate is found which is its own issuer it is assumed to be the root CA.</p> <p>The process of 'looking up the issuers certificate' itself involves a number of steps. In versions of OpenSSL before 0.9.5a the first certificate whose subject name matched the issuer of the current certificate was assumed to be the issuers certificate. In OpenSSL 0.9.6 and later all certificates whose subject name matches the issuer name of the current certificate are subject to further tests. The relevant authority key identifier components of the current certificate (if present) must match the subject key identifier (if present) and issuer and serial number of the candidate issuer, in addition the keyUsage extension of the candidate issuer (if present) must permit certificate signing.</p> <p>The lookup first looks in the list of untrusted certificates and if no match is found the remaining lookups are from the trusted certificates. The root CA is always looked up in the trusted certificate list: if the certificate to verify is a root certificate then an exact match must be found in the trusted list.</p> <p>The second operation is to check every untrusted certificate's extensions for consistency with the supplied purpose. If the -purpose option is not included then no checks are done. The supplied or \"leaf\" certificate must have extensions compatible with the supplied purpose and all other certificates must also be valid CA certificates. The precise extensions required are described in more detail in the CERTIFICATE EXTENSIONS section of the x509 utility.</p> <p>The third operation is to check the trust settings on the root CA. The root CA should be trusted for the supplied purpose. For compatibility with previous versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL a certificate with no trust settings is considered to be valid for all purposes. </p> <p>The final operation is to check the validity of the certificate chain. The validity period is checked against the current system time and the notBefore and notAfter dates in the certificate. The certificate signatures are also checked at this point.</p> <p>If all operations complete successfully then certificate is considered valid.

For example if a call to BIO_read() on a socket BIO returns 0 and BIO_should_retry() is false then the cause will be that the connection closed. A similar condition on a file BIO will mean that it has reached EOF. Some BIO types may place additional information on the error queue. For more details see the individual BIO type manual pages.</p> <p>If the underlying I/O structure is in a blocking mode almost all current BIO types will not request a retry, because the underlying I/O calls will not. If the application knows that the BIO type will never signal a retry then it need not call BIO_should_retry() after a failed BIO I/O call. This is typically done with file BIOs.</p> <p>SSL BIOs are the only current exception to this rule: they can request a retry even if the underlying I/O structure is blocking, if a handshake occurs during a call to BIO_read(). An application can retry the failed call immediately or avoid this situation by setting SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY on the underlying SSL structure.</p> <p>While an application may retry a failed non blocking call immediately this is likely to be very inefficient because the call will fail repeatedly until data can be processed or is available. An application will normally wait until the necessary condition is satisfied. How this is done depends on the underlying I/O structure.</p> <p>For example if the cause is ultimately a socket and BIO_should_read() is true then a call to select() may be made to wait until data is available and then retry the BIO operation. By combining the retry conditions of several non blocking BIOs in a single select() call it is possible to service several BIOs in a single thread, though the performance may be poor if SSL BIOs are present because long delays can occur during the initial handshake process. </p> <p>It is possible for a BIO to block indefinitely if the underlying I/O structure cannot process or return any data. This depends on the behaviour of the platforms I/O functions. This is often not desirable: one solution is to use non blocking I/O and use a timeout on the select() (or equivalent) call.</p>"},{"location":"man3/BIO_should_retry/#bugs","title":"BUGS","text":"<p>The OpenSSL ASN1 functions cannot gracefully deal with non blocking I/O: that is they cannot retry after a partial read or write.

The OpenSSL EC library does not use this seed value but does enable you to inspect it using EC_GROUP_get0_seed. This returns a pointer to a memory block containing the seed that was used. The length of the memory block can be obtained using EC_GROUP_get_seed_len. A number of the builtin curves within the library provide seed values that can be obtained.

For Fp fields this will be the number of bits in p.  For F2^m fields this will be the value m.</p> <p>The function EC_GROUP_check_discriminant calculates the discriminant for the curve and verifies that it is valid. For a curve defined over Fp the discriminant is given by the formula 4*a^3 + 27*b^2 whilst for F2^m curves the discriminant is simply b. In either case for the curve to be valid the discriminant must be non zero.</p> <p>The function EC_GROUP_check performs a number of checks on a curve to verify that it is valid. Checks performed include verifying that the discriminant is non zero; that a generator has been defined; that the generator is on the curve and has the correct order.</p> <p>EC_GROUP_cmp compares a and b to determine whether they represent the same curve or not.</p> <p>The functions EC_GROUP_get_basis_type, EC_GROUP_get_trinomial_basis and EC_GROUP_get_pentanomial_basis should only be called for curves defined over an F2^m field.

Jacobian projective co-ordinates are expressed as three values x, y and z. Working in this co-ordinate system provides more efficient point multiplication operations. A mapping exists between Jacobian projective co-ordinates and affine co-ordinates. A Jacobian projective co-ordinate (x, y, z) can be written as an affine co-ordinate as (x/(z^2), y/(z^3)). Conversion to Jacobian projective to affine co-ordinates is simple. The co-ordinate (x, y) is mapped to (x, y, 1).

Base 64 encoding converts binary data into a printable form that uses the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, \"+\" and \"/\" to represent the data. For every 3 bytes of binary data provided 4 bytes of base 64 encoded data will be produced plus some occasional newlines (see below). If the input data length is not a multiple of 3 then the output data will be padded at the end using the \"=\" character.</p> <p>Encoding of binary data is performed in blocks of 48 input bytes (or less for the final block). For each 48 byte input block encoded 64 bytes of base 64 data is output plus an additional newline character (i.e. 65 bytes in total). The final block (which may be less than 48 bytes) will output 4 bytes for every 3 bytes of input. If the data length is not divisible by 3 then a full 4 bytes is still output for the final 1 or 2 bytes of input.

It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the buffer at out is sufficiently large to accommodate the output data. Only full blocks of data (48 bytes) will be immediately processed and output by this function. Any remainder is held in the ctx object and will be processed by a subsequent call to EVP_EncodeUpdate() or EVP_EncodeFinal(). To calculate the required size of the output buffer add together the value of inl with the amount of unprocessed data held in ctx and divide the result by 48 (ignore any remainder). This gives the number of blocks of data that will be processed. Ensure the output buffer contains 65 bytes of storage for each block, plus an additional byte for a NUL terminator. EVP_EncodeUpdate() may be called repeatedly to process large amounts of input data. In the event of an error EVP_EncodeUpdate() will set *outl to 0.</p> <p>EVP_EncodeFinal() must be called at the end of an encoding operation. It will process any partial block of data remaining in the ctx object. The output data will be stored in out and the length of the data written will be stored in *outl. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that out is sufficiently large to accommodate the output data which will never be more than 65 bytes plus an additional NUL terminator (i.e. 66 bytes in total).</p> <p>EVP_EncodeBlock() encodes a full block of input data in f and of length dlen and stores it in t. For every 3 bytes of input provided 4 bytes of output data will be produced. If dlen is not divisible by 3 then the block is encoded as a final block of data and the output is padded such that it is always divisible by 4. Additionally a NUL terminator character will be added. For example if 16 bytes of input data is provided then 24 bytes of encoded data is created plus 1 byte for a NUL terminator (i.e. 25 bytes in total). The length of the data generated without the NUL terminator is returned from the function.</p> <p>EVP_DecodeInit() initialises ctx for the start of a new decoding operation.</p> <p>EVP_DecodeUpdate() decodes inl characters of data found in the buffer pointed to by in.

It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the buffer at out is sufficiently large to accommodate the output data. This function will attempt to decode as much data as possible in 4 byte chunks. Any whitespace, newline or carriage return characters are ignored. Any partial chunk of unprocessed data (1, 2 or 3 bytes) that remains at the end will be held in the ctx object and processed by a subsequent call to EVP_DecodeUpdate(). If any illegal base 64 characters are encountered or if the base 64 padding character \"=\" is encountered in the middle of the data then the function returns -1 to indicate an error. A return value of 0 or 1 indicates successful processing of the data. A return value of 0 additionally indicates that the last input data characters processed included the base 64 padding character \"=\" and therefore no more non-padding character data is expected to be processed.

The parameters and restrictions are identical to the encryption operations except that if padding is enabled the decrypted data buffer out passed to EVP_DecryptUpdate() should have sufficient room for (inl + cipher_block_size) bytes unless the cipher block size is 1 in which case inl bytes is sufficient.</p> <p>EVP_CipherInit_ex(), EVP_CipherUpdate() and EVP_CipherFinal_ex() are functions that can be used for decryption or encryption. The operation performed depends on the value of the enc parameter. It should be set to 1 for encryption, 0 for decryption and -1 to leave the value unchanged (the actual value of 'enc' being supplied in a previous call).</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_cleanup() clears all information from a cipher context and free up any allocated memory associate with it. It should be called after all operations using a cipher are complete so sensitive information does not remain in memory.</p> <p>EVP_EncryptInit(), EVP_DecryptInit() and EVP_CipherInit() behave in a similar way to EVP_EncryptInit_ex(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex and EVP_CipherInit_ex() except the ctx parameter does not need to be initialized and they always use the default cipher implementation.</p> <p>EVP_EncryptFinal(), EVP_DecryptFinal() and EVP_CipherFinal() are identical to EVP_EncryptFinal_ex(), EVP_DecryptFinal_ex() and EVP_CipherFinal_ex(). In previous releases they also cleaned up the ctx, but this is no longer done and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_clean() must be called to free any context resources.</p> <p>EVP_get_cipherbyname(), EVP_get_cipherbynid() and EVP_get_cipherbyobj() return an EVP_CIPHER structure when passed a cipher name, a NID or an ASN1_OBJECT structure.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_nid() and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_nid() return the NID of a cipher when passed an EVP_CIPHER or EVP_CIPHER_CTX structure.  The actual NID value is an internal value which may not have a corresponding OBJECT IDENTIFIER.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding() enables or disables padding. By default encryption operations are padded using standard block padding and the padding is checked and removed when decrypting. If the pad parameter is zero then no padding is performed, the total amount of data encrypted or decrypted must then be a multiple of the block size or an error will occur.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_key_length() and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_key_length() return the key length of a cipher when passed an EVP_CIPHER or EVP_CIPHER_CTX structure. The constant EVP_MAX_KEY_LENGTH is the maximum key length for all ciphers. Note: although EVP_CIPHER_key_length() is fixed for a given cipher, the value of EVP_CIPHER_CTX_key_length() may be different for variable key length ciphers.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_key_length() sets the key length of the cipher ctx. If the cipher is a fixed length cipher then attempting to set the key length to any value other than the fixed value is an error.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_iv_length() and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_iv_length() return the IV length of a cipher when passed an EVP_CIPHER or EVP_CIPHER_CTX. It will return zero if the cipher does not use an IV.  The constant EVP_MAX_IV_LENGTH is the maximum IV length for all ciphers.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_block_size() and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size() return the block size of a cipher when passed an EVP_CIPHER or EVP_CIPHER_CTX structure. The constant EVP_MAX_IV_LENGTH is also the maximum block length for all ciphers.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_type() and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_type() return the type of the passed cipher or context. This \"type\" is the actual NID of the cipher OBJECT IDENTIFIER as such it ignores the cipher parameters and 40 bit RC2 and 128 bit RC2 have the same NID. If the cipher does not have an object identifier or does not have ASN1 support this function will return NID_undef.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_cipher() returns the EVP_CIPHER structure when passed an EVP_CIPHER_CTX structure.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_mode() and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_mode() return the block cipher mode: EVP_CIPH_ECB_MODE, EVP_CIPH_CBC_MODE, EVP_CIPH_CFB_MODE or EVP_CIPH_OFB_MODE. If the cipher is a stream cipher then EVP_CIPH_STREAM_CIPHER is returned.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_param_to_asn1() sets the AlgorithmIdentifier \"parameter\" based on the passed cipher. This will typically include any parameters and an IV. The cipher IV (if any) must be set when this call is made. This call should be made before the cipher is actually \"used\" (before any EVP_EncryptUpdate(), EVP_DecryptUpdate() calls for example). This function may fail if the cipher does not have any ASN1 support.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_asn1_to_param() sets the cipher parameters based on an ASN1 AlgorithmIdentifier \"parameter\". The precise effect depends on the cipher In the case of RC2, for example, it will set the IV and effective key length. This function should be called after the base cipher type is set but before the key is set. For example EVP_CipherInit() will be called with the IV and key set to NULL, EVP_CIPHER_asn1_to_param() will be called and finally EVP_CipherInit() again with all parameters except the key set to NULL. It is possible for this function to fail if the cipher does not have any ASN1 support or the parameters cannot be set (for example the RC2 effective key length is not supported.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_ctrl() allows various cipher specific parameters to be determined and set.</p>"},{"location":"man3/EVP_EncryptInit/#return-values","title":"RETURN VALUES","text":"<p>EVP_EncryptInit_ex(), EVP_EncryptUpdate() and EVP_EncryptFinal_ex() return 1 for success and 0 for failure.</p> <p>EVP_DecryptInit_ex() and EVP_DecryptUpdate() return 1 for success and 0 for failure.

The key type used must match keytype if it is not -1. The parameter optype is a mask indicating which operations the control can be applied to. The control command is indicated in cmd and any additional arguments in p1 and p2.</p> <p>Applications will not normally call EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl() directly but will instead call one of the algorithm specific macros below.</p> <p>The function EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl_str() allows an application to send an algorithm specific control operation to a context ctx in string form. This is intended to be used for options specified on the command line or in text files. The commands supported are documented in the openssl utility command line pages for the option -pkeyopt which is supported by the pkeyutl, genpkey and req commands.</p> <p>All the remaining \"functions\" are implemented as macros.</p> <p>The EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_signature_md() macro sets the message digest type used in a signature. It can be used with any public key algorithm supporting signature operations.</p> <p>The macro EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_padding() sets the RSA padding mode for ctx. The pad parameter can take the value RSA_PKCS1_PADDING for PKCS#1 padding, RSA_SSLV23_PADDING for SSLv23 padding, RSA_NO_PADDING for no padding, RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING for OAEP padding (encrypt and decrypt only), RSA_X931_PADDING for X9.31 padding (signature operations only) and RSA_PKCS1_PSS_PADDING (sign and verify only).</p> <p>Two RSA padding modes behave differently if EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_signature_md() is used. If this macro is called for PKCS#1 padding the plaintext buffer is an actual digest value and is encapsulated in a DigestInfo structure according to PKCS#1 when signing and this structure is expected (and stripped off) when verifying. If this control is not used with RSA and PKCS#1 padding then the supplied data is used directly and not encapsulated. In the case of X9.31 padding for RSA the algorithm identifier byte is added or checked and removed if this control is called. If it is not called then the first byte of the plaintext buffer is expected to be the algorithm identifier byte.</p> <p>The EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_pss_saltlen() macro sets the RSA PSS salt length to len as its name implies it is only supported for PSS padding.  Two special values are supported: -1 sets the salt length to the digest length. When signing -2 sets the salt length to the maximum permissible value. When verifying -2 causes the salt length to be automatically determined based on the PSS block structure. If this macro is not called a salt length value of -2 is used by default.</p> <p>The EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_rsa_keygen_bits() macro sets the RSA key length for RSA key genration to bits. If not specified 1024 bits is used.</p> <p>The EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_keygen_pubexp() macro sets the public exponent value for RSA key generation to pubexp currently it should be an odd integer. The pubexp pointer is used internally by this function so it should not be modified or free after the call. If this macro is not called then 65537 is used.</p> <p>The macro EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_dsa_paramgen_bits() sets the number of bits used for DSA parameter generation to bits. If not specified 1024 is used.</p> <p>The macro EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_dh_paramgen_prime_len() sets the length of the DH prime parameter p for DH parameter generation. If this macro is not called then 1024 is used.</p> <p>The EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_dh_paramgen_generator() macro sets DH generator to gen for DH parameter generation. If not specified 2 is used.</p> <p>The EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_ec_paramgen_curve_nid() sets the EC curve for EC parameter generation to nid.

These two operations can be used to iterate over all certificates in an SSL_CTX structure.</p> <p>SSL_set_current_cert() also supports the option SSL_CERT_SET_SERVER. If ssl is a server and has sent a certificate to a connected client this option sets that certificate to the current certificate and returns 1. If the negotiated ciphersuite is anonymous (and thus no certificate will be sent) 2 is returned and the current certificate is unchanged. If ssl is not a server or a certificate has not been sent 0 is returned and the current certificate is unchanged.</p> <p>All these functions are implemented as macros.

This can only be accomplished by either adding the intermediate CA certificates into the trusted certificate store for the SSL_CTX object (resulting in having to add CA certificates that otherwise maybe would not be trusted), or by adding the chain certificates using the SSL_CTX_add_extra_chain_cert(3) function, which is only available for the SSL_CTX object as a whole and that therefore probably can only apply for one client certificate, making the concept of the callback function (to allow the choice from several certificates) questionable.</p> <p>Once the SSL object has been used in conjunction with the callback function, the certificate will be set for the SSL object and will not be cleared even when SSL_clear(3) is being called. It is therefore mandatory to destroy the SSL object using SSL_free(3) and create a new one to return to the previous state.</p>"},{"location":"man3/SSL_CTX_set_client_cert_cb/#see-also","title":"SEE ALSO","text":"<p>ssl(3), SSL_CTX_use_certificate(3), SSL_CTX_add_extra_chain_cert(3), SSL_get_client_CA_list(3), SSL_clear(3), SSL_free(3)</p>"},{"location":"man3/SSL_CTX_set_custom_cli_ext/","title":"SSL_CTX_set_custom_cli_ext","text":""},{"location":"man3/SSL_CTX_set_custom_cli_ext/#name","title":"NAME","text":"<p>SSL_CTX_add_client_custom_ext, SSL_CTX_add_server_custom_ext - custom TLS extension handling</p>"},{"location":"man3/SSL_CTX_set_custom_cli_ext/#synopsis","title":"SYNOPSIS","text":"<pre><code>#include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;\n\nint SSL_CTX_add_client_custom_ext(SSL_CTX *ctx, unsigned int ext_type,\n                                  custom_ext_add_cb add_cb,\n                                  custom_ext_free_cb free_cb, void *add_arg,\n                                  custom_ext_parse_cb parse_cb,\n                                  void *parse_arg);\n\nint SSL_CTX_add_server_custom_ext(SSL_CTX *ctx, unsigned int ext_type,\n                                  custom_ext_add_cb add_cb,\n                                  custom_ext_free_cb free_cb, void *add_arg,\n                                  custom_ext_parse_cb parse_cb,\n                                  void *parse_arg);\n\nint SSL_extension_supported(unsigned int ext_type);\n\ntypedef int (*custom_ext_add_cb)(SSL *s, unsigned int ext_type,\n                                 const unsigned char **out,\n                                 size_t *outlen, int *al,\n                                 void *add_arg);\n\ntypedef void (*custom_ext_free_cb)(SSL *s, unsigned int ext_type,\n                                   const unsigned char *out,\n                                   void *add_arg);\n\ntypedef int (*custom_ext_parse_cb)(SSL *s, unsigned int ext_type,\n                                   const unsigned char *in,\n                                   size_t inlen, int *al,\n                                   void *parse_arg);\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"man3/SSL_CTX_set_custom_cli_ext/#description","title":"DESCRIPTION","text":"<p>SSL_CTX_add_client_custom_ext() adds a custom extension for a TLS client with extension type ext_type and callbacks add_cb, free_cb and parse_cb.</p> <p>SSL_CTX_add_server_custom_ext() adds a custom extension for a TLS server with extension type ext_type and callbacks add_cb, free_cb and parse_cb.</p> <p>In both cases the extension type must not be handled by OpenSSL internally or an error occurs.</p> <p>SSL_extension_supported() returns 1 if the extension ext_type is handled internally by OpenSSL and 0 otherwise.</p>"},{"location":"man3/SSL_CTX_set_custom_cli_ext/#extension-callbacks","title":"EXTENSION CALLBACKS","text":"<p>The callback add_cb is called to send custom extension data to be included in ClientHello for TLS clients or ServerHello for servers.

The session id is an arbitrary sequence of bytes. The length of the session id is 16 bytes for SSLv2 sessions and between 1 and 32 bytes for SSLv3/TLSv1. The session id is not security critical but must be unique for the server. Additionally, the session id is transmitted in the clear when reusing the session so it must not contain sensitive information.</p> <p>Without a callback being set, an OpenSSL server will generate a unique session id from pseudo random numbers of the maximum possible length. Using the callback function, the session id can be changed to contain additional information like e.g. a host id in order to improve load balancing or external caching techniques.</p> <p>The callback function receives a pointer to the memory location to put id into and a pointer to the maximum allowed length id_len. The buffer at location id is only guaranteed to have the size id_len. The callback is only allowed to generate a shorter id and reduce id_len; the callback must never increase id_len or write to the location id exceeding the given limit.</p> <p>If a SSLv2 session id is generated and id_len is reduced, it will be restored after the callback has finished and the session id will be padded with 0x00. It is not recommended to change the id_len for SSLv2 sessions. The callback can use the SSL_get_version(3) function to check, whether the session is of type SSLv2.</p> <p>The location id is filled with 0x00 before the callback is called, so the callback may only fill part of the possible length and leave id_len untouched while maintaining reproducibility.</p> <p>Since the sessions must be distinguished, session ids must be unique. Without the callback a random number is used, so that the probability of generating the same session id is extremely small (2^128 possible ids for an SSLv2 session, 2^256 for SSLv3/TLSv1). In order to assure the uniqueness of the generated session id, the callback must call SSL_has_matching_session_id() and generate another id if a conflict occurs. If an id conflict is not resolved, the handshake will fail. If the application codes e.g. a unique host id, a unique process number, and a unique sequence number into the session id, uniqueness could easily be achieved without randomness added (it should however be taken care that no confidential information is leaked this way). If the application can not guarantee uniqueness, it is recommended to use the maximum id_len and fill in the bytes not used to code special information with random data to avoid collisions.</p> <p>SSL_has_matching_session_id() will only query the internal session cache, not the external one. Since the session id is generated before the handshake is completed, it is not immediately added to the cache. If another thread is using the same internal session cache, a race condition can occur in that another thread generates the same session id. Collisions can also occur when using an external session cache, since the external cache is not tested with SSL_has_matching_session_id() and the same race condition applies.</p> <p>When calling SSL_has_matching_session_id() for an SSLv2 session with reduced id_len, the match operation will be performed using the fixed length required and with a 0x00 padded id.</p> <p>The callback must return 0 if it cannot generate a session id for whatever reason and return 1 on success.</p>"},{"location":"man3/SSL_CTX_set_generate_session_id/#examples","title":"EXAMPLES","text":"<p>The callback function listed will generate a session id with the server id given, and will fill the rest with pseudo random bytes:</p> <pre><code>const char session_id_prefix = \"www-18\";\n\n#define MAX_SESSION_ID_ATTEMPTS 10\nstatic int generate_session_id(const SSL *ssl, unsigned char *id,\n                             unsigned int *id_len)\n     {\n     unsigned int count = 0;\n     const char *version;\n\n     version = SSL_get_version(ssl);\n     if (!strcmp(version, \"SSLv2\"))\n         /* we must not change id_len */;\n\n     do      {\n             RAND_pseudo_bytes(id, *id_len);\n             /* Prefix the session_id with the required prefix.

The behaviour of SSL_read() depends on the underlying BIO. </p> <p>For the transparent negotiation to succeed, the ssl must have been initialized to client or server mode. This is being done by calling SSL_set_connect_state(3) or SSL_set_accept_state() before the first call to an SSL_read() or SSL_write(3) function.</p> <p>SSL_read() works based on the SSL/TLS records. The data are received in records (with a maximum record size of 16kB for SSLv3/TLSv1). Only when a record has been completely received, it can be processed (decryption and check of integrity). Therefore data that was not retrieved at the last call of SSL_read() can still be buffered inside the SSL layer and will be retrieved on the next call to SSL_read(). If num is higher than the number of bytes buffered, SSL_read() will return with the bytes buffered. If no more bytes are in the buffer, SSL_read() will trigger the processing of the next record. Only when the record has been received and processed completely, SSL_read() will return reporting success. At most the contents of the record will be returned. As the size of an SSL/TLS record may exceed the maximum packet size of the underlying transport (e.g. TCP), it may be necessary to read several packets from the transport layer before the record is complete and SSL_read() can succeed.</p> <p>If the underlying BIO is blocking, SSL_read() will only return, once the read operation has been finished or an error occurred, except when a renegotiation take place, in which case a SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ may occur. This behaviour can be controlled with the SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY flag of the SSL_CTX_set_mode(3) call.</p> <p>If the underlying BIO is non-blocking, SSL_read() will also return when the underlying BIO could not satisfy the needs of SSL_read() to continue the operation. In this case a call to SSL_get_error(3) with the return value of SSL_read() will yield SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE. As at any time a re-negotiation is possible, a call to SSL_read() can also cause write operations! The calling process then must repeat the call after taking appropriate action to satisfy the needs of SSL_read(). The action depends on the underlying BIO. When using a non-blocking socket, nothing is to be done, but select() can be used to check for the required condition. When using a buffering BIO, like a BIO pair, data must be written into or retrieved out of the BIO before being able to continue.</p> <p>SSL_pending(3) can be used to find out whether there are buffered bytes available for immediate retrieval.

If this flag is set then additional status codes will be sent to the verification callback and it must be prepared to handle such cases without assuming they are hard errors.</p> <p>The X509_V_FLAG_NO_ALT_CHAINS flag suppresses checking for alternative chains. By default, when building a certificate chain, if the first certificate chain found is not trusted, then OpenSSL will continue to check to see if an alternative chain can be found that is trusted. With this flag set the behaviour will match that of OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.2b.</p> <p>The X509_V_FLAG_TRUSTED_FIRST flag causes chain construction to look for issuers in the trust store before looking at the untrusted certificates provided as part of the the peer chain. Though it is not on by default in OpenSSL 1.0.2, applications should generally set this flag. Local issuer certificates are often more likely to satisfy local security requirements and lead to a locally trusted root. This is especially important When some certificates in the trust store have explicit trust settings (see \"TRUST SETTINGS\" in x509(1)).</p> <p>The X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN flag causes intermediate certificates in the trust store to be treated as trust-anchors, in the same way as the self-signed root CA certificates. This makes it possible to trust certificates issued by an intermediate CA without having to trust its ancestor root CA. With OpenSSL 1.0.2, chain construction continues as long as there are additional trusted issuers in the trust store, and the last trusted issuer becomes the trust-anchor. Thus, even when an intermediate certificate is found in the trust store, the verified chain passed to callbacks may still be anchored by a root CA.</p>"},{"location":"man3/X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags/#notes","title":"NOTES","text":"<p>The above functions should be used to manipulate verification parameters instead of legacy functions which work in specific structures such as X509_STORE_CTX_set_flags().</p>"},{"location":"man3/X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags/#bugs","title":"BUGS","text":"<p>Delta CRL checking is currently primitive.

It uses a variable size key, but typically, 128 bit (16 byte) keys are considered good for strong encryption.  Blowfish can be used in the same modes as DES (see des_modes(7)).  Blowfish is currently one of the faster block ciphers.  It is quite a bit faster than DES, and much faster than IDEA or RC2.</p> <p>Blowfish consists of a key setup phase and the actual encryption or decryption phase.</p> <p>BF_set_key() sets up the BF_KEY key using the len bytes long key at data.</p> <p>BF_ecb_encrypt() is the basic Blowfish encryption and decryption function. It encrypts or decrypts the first 64 bits of in using the key key, putting the result in out.  enc decides if encryption (BF_ENCRYPT) or decryption (BF_DECRYPT) shall be performed.  The vector pointed at by in and out must be 64 bits in length, no less.  If they are larger, everything after the first 64 bits is ignored.</p> <p>The mode functions BF_cbc_encrypt(), BF_cfb64_encrypt() and BF_ofb64_encrypt() all operate on variable length data.  They all take an initialization vector ivec which needs to be passed along into the next call of the same function for the same message.  ivec may be initialized with anything, but the recipient needs to know what it was initialized with, or it won't be able to decrypt.  Some programs and protocols simplify this, like SSH, where ivec is simply initialized to zero. BF_cbc_encrypt() operates on data that is a multiple of 8 bytes long, while BF_cfb64_encrypt() and BF_ofb64_encrypt() are used to encrypt an variable number of bytes (the amount does not have to be an exact multiple of 8).  The purpose of the latter two is to simulate stream ciphers, and therefore, they need the parameter num, which is a pointer to an integer where the current offset in ivec is stored between calls.  This integer must be initialized to zero when ivec is initialized.</p> <p>BF_cbc_encrypt() is the Cipher Block Chaining function for Blowfish.  It encrypts or decrypts the 64 bits chunks of in using the key schedule, putting the result in out.  enc decides if encryption (BF_ENCRYPT) or decryption (BF_DECRYPT) shall be performed.  ivec must point at an 8 byte long initialization vector.</p> <p>BF_cfb64_encrypt() is the CFB mode for Blowfish with 64 bit feedback. It encrypts or decrypts the bytes in in using the key schedule, putting the result in out.  enc decides if encryption (BF_ENCRYPT) or decryption (BF_DECRYPT) shall be performed.  ivec must point at an 8 byte long initialization vector. num must point at an integer which must be initially zero.</p> <p>BF_ofb64_encrypt() is the OFB mode for Blowfish with 64 bit feedback. It uses the same parameters as BF_cfb64_encrypt(), which must be initialized the same way.</p> <p>BF_encrypt() and BF_decrypt() are the lowest level functions for Blowfish encryption.  They encrypt/decrypt the first 64 bits of the vector pointed by data, using the key key.  These functions should not be used unless you implement 'modes' of Blowfish.  The alternative is to use BF_ecb_encrypt(). If you still want to use these functions, you should be aware that they take each 32-bit chunk in host-byte order, which is little-endian on little-endian platforms and big-endian on big-endian ones.</p>"},{"location":"man3/blowfish/#return-values","title":"RETURN VALUES","text":"<p>None of the functions presented here return any

The first is the generation of a DES_key_schedule from a key, the second is the actual encryption.  A DES key is of type DES_cblock. This type is consists of 8 bytes with odd parity.  The least significant bit in each byte is the parity bit.  The key schedule is an expanded form of the key; it is used to speed the encryption process.</p> <p>DES_random_key() generates a random key.  The PRNG must be seeded prior to using this function (see rand(3)).  If the PRNG could not generate a secure key, 0 is returned.</p> <p>Before a DES key can be used, it must be converted into the architecture dependent DES_key_schedule via the DES_set_key_checked() or DES_set_key_unchecked() function.</p> <p>DES_set_key_checked() will check that the key passed is of odd parity and is not a weak or semi-weak key.  If the parity is wrong, then -1 is returned.  If the key is a weak key, then -2 is returned.  If an error is returned, the key schedule is not generated.</p> <p>DES_set_key() works like DES_set_key_checked() if the DES_check_key flag is non-zero, otherwise like DES_set_key_unchecked().  These functions are available for compatibility; it is recommended to use a function that does not depend on a global variable.</p> <p>DES_set_odd_parity() sets the parity of the passed key to odd.</p> <p>DES_is_weak_key() returns 1 if the passed key is a weak key, 0 if it is ok.  </p> <p>The following routines mostly operate on an input and output stream of _DES_cblock_s.</p> <p>DES_ecb_encrypt() is the basic DES encryption routine that encrypts or decrypts a single 8-byte DES_cblock in electronic code book (ECB) mode.  It always transforms the input data, pointed to by input, into the output data, pointed to by the output argument. If the encrypt argument is non-zero (DES_ENCRYPT), the input (cleartext) is encrypted in to the output (ciphertext) using the key_schedule specified by the schedule argument, previously set via DES_set_key. If encrypt is zero (DES_DECRYPT), the input (now ciphertext) is decrypted into the output (now cleartext).  Input and output may overlap.  DES_ecb_encrypt() does not return a value.</p> <p>DES_ecb3_encrypt() encrypts/decrypts the input block by using three-key Triple-DES encryption in ECB mode.  This involves encrypting the input with ks1, decrypting with the key schedule ks2, and then encrypting with ks3.  This routine greatly reduces the chances of brute force breaking of DES and has the advantage of if ks1, ks2 and ks3 are the same, it is equivalent to just encryption using ECB mode and ks1 as the key.</p> <p>The macro DES_ecb2_encrypt() is provided to perform two-key Triple-DES encryption by using ks1 for the final encryption.</p> <p>DES_ncbc_encrypt() encrypts/decrypts using the cipher-block-chaining (CBC) mode of DES.  If the encrypt argument is non-zero, the routine cipher-block-chain encrypts the cleartext data pointed to by the input argument into the ciphertext pointed to by the output argument, using the key schedule provided by the schedule argument, and initialization vector provided by the ivec argument.  If the length argument is not an integral multiple of eight bytes, the last block is copied to a temporary area and zero filled.  The output is always an integral multiple of eight bytes.</p> <p>DES_xcbc_encrypt() is RSA's DESX mode of DES.  It uses inw and outw to 'whiten' the encryption.  inw and outw are secret (unlike the iv) and are as such, part of the key.  So the key is sort of 24 bytes.  This is much better than CBC DES.</p> <p>DES_ede3_cbc_encrypt() implements outer triple CBC DES encryption with three keys. This means that each DES operation inside the CBC mode is an <code>C=E(ks3,D(ks2,E(ks1,M)))</code>.  This mode is used by SSL.</p> <p>The DES_ede2_cbc_encrypt() macro implements two-key Triple-DES by reusing ks1 for the final encryption.  <code>C=E(ks1,D(ks2,E(ks1,M)))</code>. This form of Triple-DES is used by the RSAREF library.</p> <p>DES_pcbc_encrypt() encrypt/decrypts using the propagating cipher block chaining mode used by Kerberos v4. Its parameters are the same as DES_ncbc_encrypt().</p> <p>DES_cfb_encrypt() encrypt/decrypts using cipher feedback mode.  This method takes an array of characters as input and outputs and array of characters.  It does not require any padding to 8 character groups. Note: the ivec variable is changed and the new changed value needs to be passed to the next call to this function.  Since this function runs a complete DES ECB encryption per numbits, this function is only suggested for use when sending small numbers of characters.</p> <p>DES_cfb64_encrypt() implements CFB mode of DES with 64bit feedback.  Why is this useful you ask?  Because this routine will allow you to encrypt an arbitrary number of bytes, no 8 byte padding.  Each call to this routine will encrypt the input bytes to output and then update ivec and num.  num contains 'how far' we are though ivec.  If this does not make much sense, read more about cfb mode of DES :-).</p> <p>DES_ede3_cfb64_encrypt() and DES_ede2_cfb64_encrypt() is the same as DES_cfb64_encrypt() except that Triple-DES is used.</p> <p>DES_ofb_encrypt() encrypts using output feedback mode.  This method takes an array of characters as input and outputs and array of characters.  It does not require any padding to 8 character groups. Note: the ivec variable is changed and the new changed value needs to be passed to the next call to this function.  Since this function runs a complete DES ECB encryption per numbits, this function is only suggested for use when sending small numbers of characters.</p> <p>DES_ofb64_encrypt() is the same as DES_cfb64_encrypt() using Output Feed Back mode.</p> <p>DES_ede3_ofb64_encrypt() and DES_ede2_ofb64_encrypt() is the same as DES_ofb64_encrypt(), using Triple-DES.</p> <p>The following functions are included in the DES library for compatibility with the MIT Kerberos library.</p> <p>DES_cbc_cksum() produces an 8 byte checksum based on the input stream (via CBC encryption).  The last 4 bytes of the checksum are returned and the complete 8 bytes are placed in output. This function is used by Kerberos v4.  Other applications should use EVP_DigestInit(3) etc. instead.</p> <p>DES_quad_cksum() is a Kerberos v4 function.  It returns a 4 byte checksum from the input bytes.  The algorithm can be iterated over the input, depending on out_count, 1, 2, 3 or 4 times.  If output is non-NULL, the 8 bytes generated by each pass are written into output.</p> <p>The following are DES-based transformations:</p> <p>DES_fcrypt() is a fast version of the Unix crypt(3) function.  This version takes only a small amount of space relative to other fast crypt() implementations.  This is different to the normal crypt in that the third parameter is the buffer that the return value is written into.  It needs to be at least 14 bytes long.  This function is thread safe, unlike the normal crypt.</p> <p>DES_crypt() is a faster replacement for the normal system crypt(). This function calls DES_fcrypt() with a static array passed as the third parameter.  This emulates the normal non-thread safe semantics of crypt(3).</p> <p>DES_enc_write() writes len bytes to file descriptor fd from buffer buf. The data is encrypted via pcbc_encrypt (default) using sched for the key and iv as a starting vector.  The actual data send down fd consists of 4 bytes (in network byte order) containing the length of the following encrypted data.  The encrypted data then follows, padded with random data out to a multiple of 8 bytes.</p> <p>DES_enc_read() is used to read len bytes from file descriptor fd into buffer buf. The data being read from fd is assumed to have come from DES_enc_write() and is decrypted using sched for the key schedule and iv for the initial vector.</p> <p>Warning: The data format used by DES_enc_write() and DES_enc_read() has a cryptographic weakness: When asked to write more than MAXWRITE bytes, DES_enc_write() will split the data into several chunks that are all encrypted using the same IV.  So don't use these functions unless you are sure you know what you do (in which case you might not want to use them anyway).  They cannot handle non-blocking sockets. DES_enc_read() uses an internal state and thus cannot be used on multiple files.</p> <p>DES_rw_mode is used to specify the encryption mode to use with DES_enc_read() and DES_end_write().  If set to DES_PCBC_MODE (the default), DES_pcbc_encrypt is used.  If set to DES_CBC_MODE DES_cbc_encrypt is used.</p>"},{"location":"man3/des/#notes","title":"NOTES","text":"<p>Single-key DES is insecure due to its short key size.

What this means is that if you set numbits to 12, and length to 2, the first 12 bits will come from the 1st input byte and the low half of the second input byte.  The second 12 bits will have the low 8 bits taken from the 3rd input byte and the top 4 bits taken from the 4th input byte.  The same holds for output.

Ie. one should obtain a new reference when making copies of an ENGINE pointer if the copies will be used (and released) independently.</p> <p>ENGINE objects have two levels of reference-counting to match the way in which the objects are used. At the most basic level, each ENGINE pointer is inherently a structural reference - a structural reference is required to use the pointer value at all, as this kind of reference is a guarantee that the structure can not be deallocated until the reference is released.</p> <p>However, a structural reference provides no guarantee that the ENGINE is initialised and able to use any of its cryptographic implementations. Indeed it's quite possible that most ENGINEs will not initialise at all in typical environments, as ENGINEs are typically used to support specialised hardware. To use an ENGINE's functionality, you need a functional reference. This kind of reference can be considered a specialised form of structural reference, because each functional reference implicitly contains a structural reference as well - however to avoid difficult-to-find programming bugs, it is recommended to treat the two kinds of reference independently. If you have a functional reference to an ENGINE, you have a guarantee that the ENGINE has been initialised and is ready to perform cryptographic operations, and will remain initialised until after you have released your reference.</p> <p>Structural references</p> <p>This basic type of reference is used for instantiating new ENGINEs, iterating across OpenSSL's internal linked-list of loaded ENGINEs, reading information about an ENGINE, etc. Essentially a structural reference is sufficient if you only need to query or manipulate the data of an ENGINE implementation rather than use its functionality.</p> <p>The ENGINE_new() function returns a structural reference to a new (empty) ENGINE object. There are other ENGINE API functions that return structural references such as; ENGINE_by_id(), ENGINE_get_first(), ENGINE_get_last(), ENGINE_get_next(), ENGINE_get_prev(). All structural references should be released by a corresponding to call to the ENGINE_free() function - the ENGINE object itself will only actually be cleaned up and deallocated when the last structural reference is released.</p> <p>It should also be noted that many ENGINE API function calls that accept a structural reference will internally obtain another reference - typically this happens whenever the supplied ENGINE will be needed by OpenSSL after the function has returned. Eg. the function to add a new ENGINE to OpenSSL's internal list is ENGINE_add() - if this function returns success, then OpenSSL will have stored a new structural reference internally so the caller is still responsible for freeing their own reference with ENGINE_free() when they are finished with it. In a similar way, some functions will automatically release the structural reference passed to it if part of the function's job is to do so. Eg. the ENGINE_get_next() and ENGINE_get_prev() functions are used for iterating across the internal ENGINE list - they will return a new structural reference to the next (or previous) ENGINE in the list or NULL if at the end (or beginning) of the list, but in either case the structural reference passed to the function is released on behalf of the caller.</p> <p>To clarify a particular function's handling of references, one should always consult that function's documentation \"man\" page, or failing that the openssl/engine.h header file includes some hints.</p> <p>Functional references</p> <p>As mentioned, functional references exist when the cryptographic functionality of an ENGINE is required to be available. A functional reference can be obtained in one of two ways; from an existing structural reference to the required ENGINE, or by asking OpenSSL for the default operational ENGINE for a given cryptographic purpose.</p> <p>To obtain a functional reference from an existing structural reference, call the ENGINE_init() function. This returns zero if the ENGINE was not already operational and couldn't be successfully initialised (eg. lack of system drivers, no special hardware attached, etc), otherwise it will return non-zero to indicate that the ENGINE is now operational and will have allocated a new functional reference to the ENGINE. All functional references are released by calling ENGINE_finish() (which removes the implicit structural reference as well).</p> <p>The second way to get a functional reference is by asking OpenSSL for a default implementation for a given task, eg. by ENGINE_get_default_RSA(), ENGINE_get_default_cipher_engine(), etc. These are discussed in the next section, though they are not usually required by application programmers as they are used automatically when creating and using the relevant algorithm-specific types in OpenSSL, such as RSA, DSA, EVP_CIPHER_CTX, etc.</p>"},{"location":"man3/engine/#default-implementations","title":"Default implementations","text":"<p>For each supported abstraction, the ENGINE code maintains an internal table of state to control which implementations are available for a given abstraction and which should be used by default. These implementations are registered in the tables and indexed by an 'nid' value, because abstractions like EVP_CIPHER and EVP_DIGEST support many distinct algorithms and modes, and ENGINEs can support arbitrarily many of them. In the case of other abstractions like RSA, DSA, etc, there is only one \"algorithm\" so all implementations implicitly register using the same 'nid' index.</p> <p>When a default ENGINE is requested for a given abstraction/algorithm/mode, (eg. when calling RSA_new_method(NULL)), a \"get_default\" call will be made to the ENGINE subsystem to process the corresponding state table and return a functional reference to an initialised ENGINE whose implementation should be used. If no ENGINE should (or can) be used, it will return NULL and the caller will operate with a NULL ENGINE handle - this usually equates to using the conventional software implementation. In the latter case, OpenSSL will from then on behave the way it used to before the ENGINE API existed.</p> <p>Each state table has a flag to note whether it has processed this \"get_default\" query since the table was last modified, because to process this question it must iterate across all the registered ENGINEs in the table trying to initialise each of them in turn, in case one of them is operational. If it returns a functional reference to an ENGINE, it will also cache another reference to speed up processing future queries (without needing to iterate across the table). Likewise, it will cache a NULL response if no ENGINE was available so that future queries won't repeat the same iteration unless the state table changes. This behaviour can also be changed; if the ENGINE_TABLE_FLAG_NOINIT flag is set (using ENGINE_set_table_flags()), no attempted initialisations will take place, instead the only way for the state table to return a non-NULL ENGINE to the \"get_default\" query will be if one is expressly set in the table. Eg. ENGINE_set_default_RSA() does the same job as ENGINE_register_RSA() except that it also sets the state table's cached response for the \"get_default\" query. In the case of abstractions like EVP_CIPHER, where implementations are indexed by 'nid', these flags and cached-responses are distinct for each 'nid' value.</p>"},{"location":"man3/engine/#application-requirements","title":"Application requirements","text":"<p>This section will explain the basic things an application programmer should support to make the most useful elements of the ENGINE functionality available to the user. The first thing to consider is whether the programmer wishes to make alternative ENGINE modules available to the application and user. OpenSSL maintains an internal linked list of \"visible\" ENGINEs from which it has to operate - at start-up, this list is empty and in fact if an application does not call any ENGINE API calls and it uses static linking against openssl, then the resulting application binary will not contain any alternative ENGINE code at all. So the first consideration is whether any/all available ENGINE implementations should be made visible to OpenSSL - this is controlled by calling the various \"load\" functions, eg.</p> <pre><code>/* Make the \"dynamic\" ENGINE available */\nvoid ENGINE_load_dynamic(void);\n/* Make the CryptoSwift hardware acceleration support available */\nvoid ENGINE_load_cswift(void);\n/* Make support for nCipher's \"CHIL\" hardware available */\nvoid ENGINE_load_chil(void);\n...\n/* Make ALL ENGINE implementations bundled with OpenSSL available */\nvoid ENGINE_load_builtin_engines(void);\n</code></pre> <p>Having called any of these functions, ENGINE objects would have been dynamically allocated and populated with these implementations and linked into OpenSSL's internal linked list. At this point it is important to mention an important API function;</p> <pre><code>void ENGINE_cleanup(void);\n</code></pre> <p>If no ENGINE API functions are called at all in an application, then there are no inherent memory leaks to worry about from the ENGINE functionality, however if any ENGINEs are loaded, even if they are never registered or used, it is necessary to use the ENGINE_cleanup() function to correspondingly cleanup before program exit, if the caller wishes to avoid memory leaks. This mechanism uses an internal callback registration table so that any ENGINE API functionality that knows it requires cleanup can register its cleanup details to be called during ENGINE_cleanup(). This approach allows ENGINE_cleanup() to clean up after any ENGINE functionality at all that your program uses, yet doesn't automatically create linker dependencies to all possible ENGINE functionality - only the cleanup callbacks required by the functionality you do use will be required by the linker.</p> <p>The fact that ENGINEs are made visible to OpenSSL (and thus are linked into the program and loaded into memory at run-time) does not mean they are \"registered\" or called into use by OpenSSL automatically - that behaviour is something for the application to control. Some applications will want to allow the user to specify exactly which ENGINE they want used if any is to be used at all. Others may prefer to load all support and have OpenSSL automatically use at run-time any ENGINE that is able to successfully initialise - ie. to assume that this corresponds to acceleration hardware attached to the machine or some such thing. There are probably numerous other ways in which applications may prefer to handle things, so we will simply illustrate the consequences as they apply to a couple of simple cases and leave developers to consider these and the source code to openssl's builtin utilities as guides.</p> <p>Using a specific ENGINE implementation</p> <p>Here we'll assume an application has been configured by its user or admin to want to use the \"ACME\" ENGINE if it is available in the version of OpenSSL the application was compiled with. If it is available, it should be used by default for all RSA, DSA, and symmetric cipher operations, otherwise OpenSSL should use its builtin software as per usual. The following code illustrates how to approach this;</p> <pre><code>ENGINE *e;\nconst char *engine_id = \"ACME\";\nENGINE_load_builtin_engines();\ne = ENGINE_by_id(engine_id);\nif(!e)\n    /* the engine isn't available */\n    return;\nif(!ENGINE_init(e)) {\n    /* the engine couldn't initialise, release 'e' */\n    ENGINE_free(e);\n    return;\n}\nif(!ENGINE_set_default_RSA(e))\n    /* This should only happen when 'e' can't initialise, but the previous\n     * statement suggests it did. */\n    abort();\nENGINE_set_default_DSA(e);\nENGINE_set_default_ciphers(e);\n/* Release the functional reference from ENGINE_init() */\nENGINE_finish(e);\n/* Release the structural reference from ENGINE_by_id() */\nENGINE_free(e);\n</code></pre> <p>Automatically using builtin ENGINE implementations</p> <p>Here we'll assume we want to load and register all ENGINE implementations bundled with OpenSSL, such that for any cryptographic algorithm required by OpenSSL - if there is an ENGINE that implements it and can be initialised, it should be used. The following code illustrates how this can work;</p> <pre><code>/* Load all bundled ENGINEs into memory and make them visible */\nENGINE_load_builtin_engines();\n/* Register all of them for every algorithm they collectively implement */\nENGINE_register_all_complete();\n</code></pre> <p>That's all that's required. Eg. the next time OpenSSL tries to set up an RSA key, any bundled ENGINEs that implement RSA_METHOD will be passed to ENGINE_init() and if any of those succeed, that ENGINE will be set as the default for RSA use from then on.</p>"},{"location":"man3/engine/#advanced-configuration-support","title":"Advanced configuration support","text":"<p>There is a mechanism supported by the ENGINE framework that allows each ENGINE implementation to define an arbitrary set of configuration \"commands\" and expose them to OpenSSL and any applications based on OpenSSL. This mechanism is entirely based on the use of name-value pairs and assumes ASCII input (no unicode or UTF for now!), so it is ideal if applications want to provide a transparent way for users to provide arbitrary configuration \"directives\" directly to such ENGINEs. It is also possible for the application to dynamically interrogate the loaded ENGINE implementations for the names, descriptions, and input flags of their available \"control commands\", providing a more flexible configuration scheme. However, if the user is expected to know which ENGINE device he/she is using (in the case of specialised hardware, this goes without saying) then applications may not need to concern themselves with discovering the supported control commands and simply prefer to pass settings into ENGINEs exactly as they are provided by the user.</p> <p>Before illustrating how control commands work, it is worth mentioning what they are typically used for. Broadly speaking there are two uses for control commands; the first is to provide the necessary details to the implementation (which may know nothing at all specific to the host system) so that it can be initialised for use. This could include the path to any driver or config files it needs to load, required network addresses, smart-card identifiers, passwords to initialise protected devices, logging information, etc etc. This class of commands typically needs to be passed to an ENGINE before attempting to initialise it, ie. before calling ENGINE_init(). The other class of commands consist of settings or operations that tweak certain behaviour or cause certain operations to take place, and these commands may work either before or after ENGINE_init(), or in some cases both. ENGINE implementations should provide indications of this in the descriptions attached to builtin control commands and/or in external product documentation.</p> <p>Issuing control commands to an ENGINE</p> <p>Let's illustrate by example; a function for which the caller supplies the name of the ENGINE it wishes to use, a table of string-pairs for use before initialisation, and another table for use after initialisation. Note that the string-pairs used for control commands consist of a command \"name\" followed by the command \"parameter\" - the parameter could be NULL in some cases but the name can not. This function should initialise the ENGINE (issuing the \"pre\" commands beforehand and the \"post\" commands afterwards) and set it as the default for everything except RAND and then return a boolean success or failure.</p> <pre><code>int generic_load_engine_fn(const char *engine_id,\n                           const char **pre_cmds, int pre_num,\n                           const char **post_cmds, int post_num)\n{\n    ENGINE *e = ENGINE_by_id(engine_id);\n    if(!e) return 0;\n    while(pre_num--) {\n        if(!ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, pre_cmds[0], pre_cmds[1], 0)) {\n            fprintf(stderr, \"Failed command (%s - %s:%s)\\n\", engine_id,\n                pre_cmds[0], pre_cmds[1] ? pre_cmds[1] : \"(NULL)\");\n            ENGINE_free(e);\n            return 0;\n        }\n        pre_cmds += 2;\n    }\n    if(!ENGINE_init(e)) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Failed initialisation\\n\");\n        ENGINE_free(e);\n        return 0;\n    }\n    /* ENGINE_init() returned a functional reference, so free the structural\n     * reference from ENGINE_by_id(). */\n    ENGINE_free(e);\n    while(post_num--) {\n        if(!ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, post_cmds[0], post_cmds[1], 0)) {\n            fprintf(stderr, \"Failed command (%s - %s:%s)\\n\", engine_id,\n                post_cmds[0], post_cmds[1] ? post_cmds[1] : \"(NULL)\");\n            ENGINE_finish(e);\n            return 0;\n        }\n        post_cmds += 2;\n    }\n    ENGINE_set_default(e, ENGINE_METHOD_ALL &amp; ~ENGINE_METHOD_RAND);\n    /* Success */\n    return 1;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string() accepts a boolean argument that can relax the semantics of the function - if set non-zero it will only return failure if the ENGINE supported the given command name but failed while executing it, if the ENGINE doesn't support the command name it will simply return success without doing anything. In this case we assume the user is only supplying commands specific to the given ENGINE so we set this to FALSE.</p> <p>Discovering supported control commands</p> <p>It is possible to discover at run-time the names, numerical-ids, descriptions and input parameters of the control commands supported by an ENGINE using a structural reference. Note that some control commands are defined by OpenSSL itself and it will intercept and handle these control commands on behalf of the ENGINE, ie. the ENGINE's ctrl() handler is not used for the control command. openssl/engine.h defines an index, ENGINE_CMD_BASE, that all control commands implemented by ENGINEs should be numbered from. Any command value lower than this symbol is considered a \"generic\" command is handled directly by the OpenSSL core routines.</p> <p>It is using these \"core\" control commands that one can discover the the control commands implemented by a given ENGINE, specifically the commands;</p> <pre><code>#define ENGINE_HAS_CTRL_FUNCTION               10\n#define ENGINE_CTRL_GET_FIRST_CMD_TYPE         11\n#define ENGINE_CTRL_GET_NEXT_CMD_TYPE          12\n#define ENGINE_CTRL_GET_CMD_FROM_NAME          13\n#define ENGINE_CTRL_GET_NAME_LEN_FROM_CMD      14\n#define ENGINE_CTRL_GET_NAME_FROM_CMD          15\n#define ENGINE_CTRL_GET_DESC_LEN_FROM_CMD      16\n#define ENGINE_CTRL_GET_DESC_FROM_CMD          17\n#define ENGINE_CTRL_GET_CMD_FLAGS              18\n</code></pre> <p>Whilst these commands are automatically processed by the OpenSSL framework code, they use various properties exposed by each ENGINE to process these queries. An ENGINE has 3 properties it exposes that can affect how this behaves; it can supply a ctrl() handler, it can specify ENGINE_FLAGS_MANUAL_CMD_CTRL in the ENGINE's flags, and it can expose an array of control command descriptions. If an ENGINE specifies the ENGINE_FLAGS_MANUAL_CMD_CTRL flag, then it will simply pass all these \"core\" control commands directly to the ENGINE's ctrl() handler (and thus, it must have supplied one), so it is up to the ENGINE to reply to these \"discovery\" commands itself. If that flag is not set, then the OpenSSL framework code will work with the following rules;</p> <pre><code>if no ctrl() handler supplied;\n    ENGINE_HAS_CTRL_FUNCTION returns FALSE (zero),\n    all other commands fail.\nif a ctrl() handler was supplied but no array of control commands;\n    ENGINE_HAS_CTRL_FUNCTION returns TRUE,\n    all other commands fail.\nif a ctrl() handler and array of control commands was supplied;\n    ENGINE_HAS_CTRL_FUNCTION returns TRUE,\n    all other commands proceed processing ...\n</code></pre> <p>If the ENGINE's array of control commands is empty then all other commands will fail, otherwise; ENGINE_CTRL_GET_FIRST_CMD_TYPE returns the identifier of the first command supported by the ENGINE, ENGINE_GET_NEXT_CMD_TYPE takes the identifier of a command supported by the ENGINE and returns the next command identifier or fails if there are no more, ENGINE_CMD_FROM_NAME takes a string name for a command and returns the corresponding identifier or fails if no such command name exists, and the remaining commands take a command identifier and return properties of the corresponding commands. All except ENGINE_CTRL_GET_FLAGS return the string length of a command name or description, or populate a supplied character buffer with a copy of the command name or description. ENGINE_CTRL_GET_FLAGS returns a bitwise-OR'd mask of the following possible values;</p> <pre><code>#define ENGINE_CMD_FLAG_NUMERIC                (unsigned int)0x0001\n#define ENGINE_CMD_FLAG_STRING                 (unsigned int)0x0002\n#define ENGINE_CMD_FLAG_NO_INPUT               (unsigned int)0x0004\n#define ENGINE_CMD_FLAG_INTERNAL               (unsigned int)0x0008\n</code></pre> <p>If the ENGINE_CMD_FLAG_INTERNAL flag is set, then any other flags are purely informational to the caller - this flag will prevent the command being usable for any higher-level ENGINE functions such as ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(). \"INTERNAL\" commands are not intended to be exposed to text-based configuration by applications, administrations, users, etc. These can support arbitrary operations via ENGINE_ctrl(), including passing to and/or from the control commands data of any arbitrary type. These commands are supported in the discovery mechanisms simply to allow applications determinie if an ENGINE supports certain specific commands it might want to use (eg. application \"foo\" might query various ENGINEs to see if they implement \"FOO_GET_VENDOR_LOGO_GIF\" - and ENGINE could therefore decide whether or not to support this \"foo\"-specific extension).</p>"},{"location":"man3/engine/#future-developments","title":"Future developments","text":"<p>The ENGINE API and internal architecture is currently being reviewed.

The hash callback takes a pointer to a table entry as its argument and returns an unsigned long hash value for its key field.  The hash value is normally truncated to a power of 2, so make sure that your hash function returns well mixed low order bits.  The compare callback takes two arguments (pointers to two hash table entries), and returns 0 if their keys are equal, non-zero otherwise.  If your hash table will contain items of some particular type and the hash and compare callbacks hash/compare these types, then the DECLARE_LHASH_HASH_FN and IMPLEMENT_LHASH_COMP_FN macros can be used to create callback wrappers of the prototypes required by lh_&lt;type&gt;_new().

For lh_&lt;type&gt;_doall() and lh_&lt;type&gt;_doall_arg(), function pointer casting should be avoided in the callbacks (see NOTE) - instead use the declare/implement macros to create type-checked wrappers that cast variables prior to calling your type-specific callbacks.  An example of this is illustrated here where the callback is used to cleanup resources for items in the hash table prior to the hashtable itself being deallocated:</p> <pre><code>/* Cleans up resources belonging to 'a' (this is implemented elsewhere) */\nvoid STUFF_cleanup_doall(STUFF *a);\n/* Implement a prototype-compatible wrapper for \"STUFF_cleanup\" */\nIMPLEMENT_LHASH_DOALL_FN(STUFF_cleanup, STUFF)\n        /* ... then later in the code ... */\n/* So to run \"STUFF_cleanup\" against all items in a hash table ... */\nlh_STUFF_doall(hashtable, LHASH_DOALL_FN(STUFF_cleanup));\n/* Then the hash table itself can be deallocated */\nlh_STUFF_free(hashtable);\n</code></pre> <p>When doing this, be careful if you delete entries from the hash table in your callbacks: the table may decrease in size, moving the item that you are currently on down lower in the hash table - this could cause some entries to be skipped during the iteration.  The second best solution to this problem is to set hash-&gt;down_load=0 before you start (which will stop the hash table ever decreasing in size). The best solution is probably to avoid deleting items from the hash table inside a \"doall\" callback!</p> <p>lh_&lt;type&gt;_doall_arg() is the same as lh_&lt;type&gt;_doall() except that func will be called with arg as the second argument and func should be of type LHASH_DOALL_ARG_FN_TYPE (a callback prototype that is passed both the table entry and an extra argument).  As with lh_doall(), you can instead choose to declare your callback with a prototype matching the types you are dealing with and use the declare/implement macros to create compatible wrappers that cast variables before calling your type-specific callbacks.  An example of this is demonstrated here (printing all hash table entries to a BIO that is provided by the caller):</p> <pre><code>/* Prints item 'a' to 'output_bio' (this is implemented elsewhere) */\nvoid STUFF_print_doall_arg(const STUFF *a, BIO *output_bio);\n/* Implement a prototype-compatible wrapper for \"STUFF_print\" */\nstatic IMPLEMENT_LHASH_DOALL_ARG_FN(STUFF, const STUFF, BIO)\n        /* ... then later in the code ... */\n/* Print out the entire hashtable to a particular BIO */\nlh_STUFF_doall_arg(hashtable, LHASH_DOALL_ARG_FN(STUFF_print), BIO,\n                   logging_bio);\n</code></pre> <p>lh_&lt;type&gt;_error() can be used to determine if an error occurred in the last operation. lh_&lt;type&gt;_error() is a macro.</p>"},{"location":"man3/lhash/#return-values","title":"RETURN VALUES","text":"<p>lh_&lt;type&gt;_new() returns NULL on error, otherwise a pointer to the new LHASH structure.</p> <p>When a hash table entry is replaced, lh_&lt;type&gt;_insert() returns the value being replaced.

It also, apparently, violates ANSI-C.</p> <p>The LHASH code regards table entries as constant data.  As such, it internally represents lh_insert()'d items with a \"const void *\" pointer type.  This is why callbacks such as those used by lh_doall() and lh_doall_arg() declare their prototypes with \"const\", even for the parameters that pass back the table items' data pointers - for consistency, user-provided data is \"const\" at all times as far as the LHASH code is concerned.  However, as callers are themselves providing these pointers, they can choose whether they too should be treating all such parameters as constant.</p> <p>As an example, a hash table may be maintained by code that, for reasons of encapsulation, has only \"const\" access to the data being indexed in the hash table (ie. it is returned as \"const\" from elsewhere in their code) - in this case the LHASH prototypes are appropriate as-is.  Conversely, if the caller is responsible for the life-time of the data in question, then they may well wish to make modifications to table item passed back in the lh_doall() or lh_doall_arg() callbacks (see the \"STUFF_cleanup\" example above).

What makes this hash table different is that as the table fills, the hash table is increased (or decreased) in size via OPENSSL_realloc().  When a 'resize' is done, instead of all hashes being redistributed over twice as many 'buckets', one bucket is split.  So when an 'expand' is done, there is only a minimal cost to redistribute some values.  Subsequent inserts will cause more single 'bucket' redistributions but there will never be a sudden large cost due to redistributing all the 'buckets'.</p> <p>The state for a particular hash table is kept in the LHASH structure. The decision to increase or decrease the hash table size is made depending on the 'load' of the hash table.  The load is the number of items in the hash table divided by the size of the hash table.  The default values are as follows.  If (hash-&gt;up_load &lt; load) =&gt; expand.  if (hash-&gt;down_load &gt; load) =&gt; contract.  The up_load has a default value of 1 and down_load has a default value of 2.  These numbers can be modified by the application by just playing with the up_load and down_load variables.  The 'load' is kept in a form which is multiplied by 256.  So hash-&gt;up_load=8*256; will cause a load of 8 to be set.</p> <p>If you are interested in performance the field to watch is num_comp_calls.  The hash library keeps track of the 'hash' value for each item so when a lookup is done, the 'hashes' are compared, if there is a match, then a full compare is done, and hash-&gt;num_comp_calls is incremented.  If num_comp_calls is not equal to num_delete plus num_retrieve it means that your hash function is generating hashes that are the same for different values.  It is probably worth changing your hash function if this is the case because even if your hash table has 10 items in a 'bucket', it can be searched with 10 unsigned long compares and 10 linked list traverses.

For clarity the term \"foobar functions\" will be used to collectively refer to the PEM_read_bio_foobar(), PEM_read_foobar(), PEM_write_bio_foobar() and PEM_write_foobar() functions.</p> <p>The PrivateKey functions read or write a private key in PEM format using an EVP_PKEY structure. The write routines use \"traditional\" private key format and can handle both RSA and DSA private keys. The read functions can additionally transparently handle PKCS#8 format encrypted and unencrypted keys too.</p> <p>PEM_write_bio_PKCS8PrivateKey() and PEM_write_PKCS8PrivateKey() write a private key in an EVP_PKEY structure in PKCS#8 EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo format using PKCS#5 v2.0 password based encryption algorithms. The cipher argument specifies the encryption algorithm to use: unlike all other PEM routines the encryption is applied at the PKCS#8 level and not in the PEM headers. If cipher is NULL then no encryption is used and a PKCS#8 PrivateKeyInfo structure is used instead.</p> <p>PEM_write_bio_PKCS8PrivateKey_nid() and PEM_write_PKCS8PrivateKey_nid() also write out a private key as a PKCS#8 EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo however it uses PKCS#5 v1.5 or PKCS#12 encryption algorithms instead. The algorithm to use is specified in the nid parameter and should be the NID of the corresponding OBJECT IDENTIFIER (see NOTES section).</p> <p>The PUBKEY functions process a public key using an EVP_PKEY structure. The public key is encoded as a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure.</p> <p>The RSAPrivateKey functions process an RSA private key using an RSA structure. It handles the same formats as the PrivateKey functions but an error occurs if the private key is not RSA.</p> <p>The RSAPublicKey functions process an RSA public key using an RSA structure. The public key is encoded using a PKCS#1 RSAPublicKey structure.</p> <p>The RSA_PUBKEY functions also process an RSA public key using an RSA structure. However the public key is encoded using a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure and an error occurs if the public key is not RSA.</p> <p>The DSAPrivateKey functions process a DSA private key using a DSA structure. It handles the same formats as the PrivateKey functions but an error occurs if the private key is not DSA.</p> <p>The DSA_PUBKEY functions process a DSA public key using a DSA structure. The public key is encoded using a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure and an error occurs if the public key is not DSA.</p> <p>The DSAparams functions process DSA parameters using a DSA structure. The parameters are encoded using a Dss-Parms structure as defined in RFC2459.</p> <p>The DHparams functions process DH parameters using a DH structure. The parameters are encoded using a PKCS#3 DHparameter structure.</p> <p>The X509 functions process an X509 certificate using an X509 structure.

If the RNG is being used to generate 4096 bit RSA keys, 2 2048 bit random strings are required (at a minimum). If your RNG state only has 128 bits, you are obviously limiting the search space to 128 bits, not 2048.  I'm probably getting a little carried away on this last point but it does indicate that it may not be a bad idea to keep quite a lot of RNG state.  It should be easier to break a cipher than guess the RNG seed data.</li> <li>Any RNG seed data should influence all subsequent random numbers generated.  This implies that any random seed data entered will have an influence on all subsequent random numbers generated.</li> <li>When using data to seed the RNG state, the data used should not be extractable from the RNG state.  I believe this should be a requirement because one possible source of 'secret' semi random data would be a private key or a password.  This data must not be disclosed by either subsequent random numbers or a 'core' dump left by a program crash.</li> <li>Given the same initial 'state', 2 systems should deviate in their RNG state (and hence the random numbers generated) over time if at all possible.</li> <li>Given the random number output stream, it should not be possible to determine the RNG state or the next random number.</li> </ol> <p>The algorithm is as follows.</p> <p>There is global state made up of a 1023 byte buffer (the 'state'), a working hash value ('md'), and a counter ('count').</p> <p>Whenever seed data is added, it is inserted into the 'state' as follows.</p> <p>The input is chopped up into units of 20 bytes (or less for the last block).  Each of these blocks is run through the hash function as follows:  The data passed to the hash function is the current 'md', the same number of bytes from the 'state' (the location determined by in incremented looping index) as the current 'block', the new key data 'block', and 'count' (which is incremented after each use). The result of this is kept in 'md' and also xored into the 'state' at the same locations that were used as input into the hash function. I believe this system addresses points 1 (hash function; currently SHA-1), 3 (the 'state'), 4 (via the 'md'), 5 (by the use of a hash function and xor).</p> <p>When bytes are extracted from the RNG, the following process is used.

applications provided that at least two callback functions are set, the locking_function and threadid_func.

Further, the thread-safety does not extend to things like multiple threads using the same SSL object at the same time.</p> <p>locking_function(int mode, int n, const char *file, int line) is needed to perform locking on shared data structures. (Note that OpenSSL uses a number of global data structures that will be implicitly shared whenever multiple threads use OpenSSL.) Multi-threaded applications will crash at random if it is not set.</p> <p>locking_function() must be able to handle up to CRYPTO_num_locks() different mutex locks. It sets the n-th lock if mode &amp; CRYPTO_LOCK, and releases it otherwise.</p> <p>file and line are the file number of the function setting the lock. They can be useful for debugging.</p> <p>threadid_func(CRYPTO_THREADID *id) is needed to record the currently-executing thread's identifier into id. The implementation of this callback should not fill in id directly, but should use CRYPTO_THREADID_set_numeric() if thread IDs are numeric, or CRYPTO_THREADID_set_pointer() if they are pointer-based. If the application does not register such a callback using CRYPTO_THREADID_set_callback(), then a default implementation is used - on Windows and BeOS this uses the system's default thread identifying APIs, and on all other platforms it uses the address of errno. The latter is satisfactory for thread-safety if and only if the platform has a thread-local error number facility.</p> <p>Once threadid_func() is registered, or if the built-in default implementation is to be used;</p> <ul> <li>CRYPTO_THREADID_current() records the currently-executing thread ID into the given id object.</li> <li>CRYPTO_THREADID_cmp() compares two thread IDs (returning zero for equality, ie. the same semantics as memcmp()).</li> <li>CRYPTO_THREADID_cpy() duplicates a thread ID value,</li> <li>CRYPTO_THREADID_hash() returns a numeric value usable as a hash-table key. This is usually the exact numeric or pointer-based thread ID used internally, however this also handles the unusual case where pointers are larger than 'long' variables and the platform's thread IDs are pointer-based - in this case, mixing is done to attempt to produce a unique numeric value even though it is not as wide as the platform's true thread IDs.</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, OpenSSL supports dynamic locks, and sometimes, some parts of OpenSSL need it for better performance.  To enable this, the following is required:</p> <ul> <li>Three additional callback function, dyn_create_function, dyn_lock_function and dyn_destroy_function.</li> <li>A structure defined with the data that each lock needs to handle.</li> </ul> <p>struct CRYPTO_dynlock_value has to be defined to contain whatever structure is needed to handle locks.</p> <p>dyn_create_function(const char *file, int line) is needed to create a lock.

Multi-threaded applications might crash at random if it is not set.</p> <p>dyn_destroy_function(CRYPTO_dynlock *l, const char *file, int line) is needed to destroy the lock l.

Through user-written methods (see ui_create(3)), prompting can be done in any way imaginable, be it plain text prompting, through dialog boxes or from a cell phone.</p> <p>All the functions work through a context of the type UI.  This context contains all the information needed to prompt correctly as well as a reference to a UI_METHOD, which is an ordered vector of functions that carry out the actual prompting.</p> <p>The first thing to do is to create a UI with UI_new() or UI_new_method(), then add information to it with the UI_add or UI_dup functions.  Also, user-defined random data can be passed down to the underlying method through calls to UI_add_user_data.  The default UI method doesn't care about these data, but other methods might.  Finally, use UI_process() to actually perform the prompting and UI_get0_result() to find the result to the prompt.</p> <p>A UI can contain more than one prompt, which are performed in the given sequence.  Each prompt gets an index number which is returned by the UI_add and UI_dup functions, and has to be used to get the corresponding result with UI_get0_result().</p> <p>The functions are as follows:</p> <p>UI_new() creates a new UI using the default UI method.  When done with this UI, it should be freed using UI_free().</p> <p>UI_new_method() creates a new UI using the given UI method.  When done with this UI, it should be freed using UI_free().</p> <p>UI_OpenSSL() returns the built-in UI method (note: not the default one, since the default can be changed.  See further on).  This method is the most machine/OS dependent part of OpenSSL and normally generates the most problems when porting.</p> <p>UI_free() removes a UI from memory, along with all other pieces of memory that's connected to it, like duplicated input strings, results and others.</p> <p>UI_add_input_string() and UI_add_verify_string() add a prompt to the UI, as well as flags and a result buffer and the desired minimum and maximum sizes of the result, not counting the final NUL character.  The given information is used to prompt for information, for example a password, and to verify a password (i.e. having the user enter it twice and check that the same string was entered twice).  UI_add_verify_string() takes and extra argument that should be a pointer to the result buffer of the input string that it's supposed to verify, or verification will fail.</p> <p>UI_add_input_boolean() adds a prompt to the UI that's supposed to be answered in a boolean way, with a single character for yes and a different character for no.  A set of characters that can be used to cancel the prompt is given as well.  The prompt itself is divided in two, one part being the descriptive text (given through the prompt argument) and one describing the possible answers (given through the action_desc argument).</p> <p>UI_add_info_string() and UI_add_error_string() add strings that are shown at the same time as the prompt for extra information or to show an error string. The difference between the two is only conceptual.  With the builtin method, there's no technical difference between them.  Other methods may make a difference between them, however.</p> <p>The flags currently supported are UI_INPUT_FLAG_ECHO, which is relevant for UI_add_input_string() and will have the users response be echoed (when prompting for a password, this flag should obviously not be used, and UI_INPUT_FLAG_DEFAULT_PWD, which means that a default password of some sort will be used (completely depending on the application and the UI method).</p> <p>UI_dup_input_string(), UI_dup_verify_string(), UI_dup_input_boolean(), UI_dup_info_string() and UI_dup_error_string() are basically the same as their UI_add counterparts, except that they make their own copies of all strings.</p> <p>UI_construct_prompt() is a helper function that can be used to create a prompt from two pieces of information: an description and a name. The default constructor (if there is none provided by the method used) creates a string \"Enter description for name:\".  With the description \"pass phrase\" and the file name \"foo.key\", that becomes \"Enter pass phrase for foo.key:\".  Other methods may create whatever string and may include encodings that will be processed by the other method functions.</p> <p>UI_add_user_data() adds a piece of memory for the method to use at any time.  The builtin UI method doesn't care about this info.  Note that several calls to this function doesn't add data, it replaces the previous blob with the one given as argument.</p> <p>UI_get0_user_data() retrieves the data that has last been given to the UI with UI_add_user_data().</p> <p>UI_get0_result() returns a pointer to the result buffer associated with the information indexed by i.</p> <p>UI_process() goes through the information given so far, does all the printing and prompting and returns.</p> <p>UI_ctrl() adds extra control for the application author.  For now, it understands two commands: UI_CTRL_PRINT_ERRORS, which makes UI_process() print the OpenSSL error stack as part of processing the UI, and UI_CTRL_IS_REDOABLE, which returns a flag saying if the used UI can be used again or not.</p> <p>UI_set_default_method() changes the default UI method to the one given.</p> <p>UI_get_default_method() returns a pointer to the current default UI method.</p> <p>UI_get_method() returns the UI method associated with a given UI.</p> <p>UI_set_method() changes the UI method associated with a given UI.</p>"},{"location":"man3/ui/#see-also","title":"SEE ALSO","text":"<p>ui_create(3), ui_compat(3)</p>"},{"location":"man3/ui/#history","title":"HISTORY","text":"<p>The UI section was first introduced in OpenSSL 0.9.7.</p>"},{"location":"man3/ui/#author","title":"AUTHOR","text":"<p>Richard Levitte (richard@levitte.org) for the OpenSSL project (http://www.openssl.org).</p>"},{"location":"man3/ui_compat/","title":"ui_compat","text":""},{"location":"man3/ui_compat/#name","title":"NAME","text":"<p>des_read_password, des_read_2passwords, des_read_pw_string, des_read_pw - Compatibility user interface functions</p>"},{"location":"man3/ui_compat/#synopsis","title":"SYNOPSIS","text":"<pre><code>#include &lt;openssl/des_old.h&gt;\n\nint des_read_password(DES_cblock *key,const char *prompt,int verify);\nint des_read_2passwords(DES_cblock *key1,DES_cblock *key2,\n       const char *prompt,int verify);\n\nint des_read_pw_string(char *buf,int length,const char *prompt,int verify);\nint des_read_pw(char *buf,char *buff,int size,const char *prompt,int verify);\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"man3/ui_compat/#description","title":"DESCRIPTION","text":"<p>The DES library contained a few routines to prompt for passwords.

A X.509 CRL (certificate revocation list) is a tool to help determine if a certificate is still valid.  The exact definition of those can be found in the X.509 document from ITU-T, or in RFC3280 from PKIX. In OpenSSL, the type X509 is used to express such a certificate, and the type X509_CRL is used to express a CRL.</p> <p>A related structure is a certificate request, defined in PKCS#10 from RSA Security, Inc, also reflected in RFC2896.
