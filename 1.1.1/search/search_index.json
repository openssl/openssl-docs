The user is prompted to enter the filename of the CA certificates (which should also contain the private key) or by hitting ENTER details of the CA will be prompted for.

It expects the user certificate and private key to be in the file \"newcert.pem\" and the CA certificate to be in the file demoCA/cacert.pem, it creates a file \"newcert.p12\". This command can thus be called after the -sign option. The PKCS#12 file can be imported directly into a browser.

Empty values are permitted, but the corresponding type will not be included in the resulting certificate.</p> </li> <li> <p>-utf8</p> <p>This option causes field values to be interpreted as UTF8 strings, by default they are interpreted as ASCII. This means that the field values, whether prompted from a terminal or obtained from a configuration file, must be valid UTF8 strings.</p> </li> <li> <p>-create_serial</p> <p>If reading serial from the text file as specified in the configuration fails, specifying this option creates a new random serial to be used as next serial number.

The meaning of the other options varies according to the operation type.</p> <ul> <li> <p>-help</p> <p>Print out a usage message.</p> </li> <li> <p>-encrypt</p> <p>Encrypt mail for the given recipient certificates. Input file is the message to be encrypted. The output file is the encrypted mail in MIME format. The actual CMS type is EnvelopedData. <p>Note that no revocation check is done for the recipient cert, so if that key has been compromised, others may be able to decrypt the text.</p> <li> <p>-decrypt</p> <p>Decrypt mail using the supplied certificate and private key. Expects an encrypted mail message in MIME format for the input file. The decrypted mail is written to the output file.</p> </li> <li> <p>-debug_decrypt</p> <p>This option sets the CMS_DEBUG_DECRYPT flag. This option should be used with caution: see the notes section below.</p> </li> <li> <p>-sign</p> <p>Sign mail using the supplied certificate and private key. Input file is the message to be signed. The signed message in MIME format is written to the output file.</p> </li> <li> <p>-verify</p> <p>Verify signed mail. Expects a signed mail message on input and outputs the signed data. Both clear text and opaque signing is supported.</p> </li> <li> <p>-cmsout</p> <p>Takes an input message and writes out a PEM encoded CMS structure.</p> </li> <li> <p>-resign</p> <p>Resign a message: take an existing message and one or more new signers.</p> </li> <li> <p>-data_create</p> <p>Create a CMS Data type.</p> </li> <li> <p>-data_out</p> <p>Data type and output the content.</p> </li> <li> <p>-digest_create</p> <p>Create a CMS DigestedData type.</p> </li> <li> <p>-digest_verify</p> <p>Verify a CMS DigestedData type and output the content.</p> </li> <li> <p>-compress</p> <p>Create a CMS CompressedData type.

OpenSSL must be compiled with zlib support for this option to work, otherwise it will output an error.</p> </li> <li> <p>-EncryptedData_encrypt</p> <p>Encrypt content using supplied symmetric key and algorithm using a CMS EncryptedData type and output the content.</p> </li> <li> <p>-sign_receipt</p> <p>Generate and output a signed receipt for the supplied message. The input message must contain a signed receipt request. Functionality is otherwise similar to the -sign operation.</p> </li> <li> <p>-verify_receipt receipt</p> <p>Verify a signed receipt in filename receipt. The input message must contain the original receipt request. Functionality is otherwise similar to the -verify operation.</p> </li> <li> <p>-in filename</p> <p>The input message to be encrypted or signed or the message to be decrypted or verified.</p> </li> <li> <p>-inform SMIME|PEM|DER</p> <p>This specifies the input format for the CMS structure. The default is SMIME which reads an S/MIME format message. PEM and DER format change this to expect PEM and DER format CMS structures instead. This currently only affects the input format of the CMS structure, if no CMS structure is being input (for example with -encrypt or -sign) this option has no effect.</p> </li> <li> <p>-rctform SMIME|PEM|DER</p> <p>Specify the format for a signed receipt for use with the -receipt_verify operation.</p> </li> <li> <p>-out filename</p> <p>The message text that has been decrypted or verified or the output MIME format message that has been signed or verified.</p> </li> <li> <p>-outform SMIME|PEM|DER</p> <p>This specifies the output format for the CMS structure. The default is SMIME which writes an S/MIME format message. PEM and DER format change this to write PEM and DER format CMS structures instead. This currently only affects the output format of the CMS structure, if no CMS structure is being output (for example with -verify or -decrypt) this option has no effect.</p> </li> <li> <p>-stream -indef -noindef</p> <p>The -stream and -indef options are equivalent and enable streaming I/O for encoding operations. This permits single pass processing of data without the need to hold the entire contents in memory, potentially supporting very large files. Streaming is automatically set for S/MIME signing with detached data if the output format is SMIME it is currently off by default for all other operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>-noindef</p> <p>Disable streaming I/O where it would produce and indefinite length constructed encoding. This option currently has no effect. In future streaming will be enabled by default on all relevant operations and this option will disable it.</p> </li> <li> <p>-content filename</p> <p>This specifies a file containing the detached content, this is only useful with the -verify command. This is only usable if the CMS structure is using the detached signature form where the content is not included. This option will override any content if the input format is S/MIME and it uses the multipart/signed MIME content type.</p> </li> <li> <p>-text</p> <p>This option adds plain text (text/plain) MIME headers to the supplied message if encrypting or signing. If decrypting or verifying it strips off text headers: if the decrypted or verified message is not of MIME type text/plain then an error occurs.</p> </li> <li> <p>-noout</p> <p>For the -cmsout operation do not output the parsed CMS structure. This is useful when combined with the -print option or if the syntax of the CMS structure is being checked.</p> </li> <li> <p>-print</p> <p>For the -cmsout operation print out all fields of the CMS structure. This is mainly useful for testing purposes.</p> </li> <li> <p>-CAfile file</p> <p>A file containing trusted CA certificates, only used with -verify.</p> </li> <li> <p>-CApath dir</p> <p>A directory containing trusted CA certificates, only used with -verify. This directory must be a standard certificate directory: that is a hash of each subject name (using x509 -hash) should be linked to each certificate.</p> </li> <li> <p>-no-CAfile</p> <p>Do not load the trusted CA certificates from the default file location</p> </li> <li> <p>-no-CApath</p> <p>Do not load the trusted CA certificates from the default directory location</p> </li> <li> <p>-md digest</p> <p>Digest algorithm to use when signing or resigning. If not present then the default digest algorithm for the signing key will be used (usually SHA1).</p> </li> <li> <p>-cipher</p> <p>The encryption algorithm to use. For example triple DES (168 bits) - -des3 or 256 bit AES - -aes256. Any standard algorithm name (as used by the EVP_get_cipherbyname() function) can also be used preceded by a dash, for example -aes-128-cbc. See enc(1) for a list of ciphers supported by your version of OpenSSL.</p> <p>If not specified triple DES is used. Only used with -encrypt and -EncryptedData_create commands.</p> </li> <li> <p>-nointern</p> <p>When verifying a message normally certificates (if any) included in the message are searched for the signing certificate. With this option only the certificates specified in the -certfile option are used. The supplied certificates can still be used as untrusted CAs however.</p> </li> <li> <p>-noverify</p> <p>Do not verify the signers certificate of a signed message.</p> </li> <li> <p>-nocerts</p> <p>When signing a message the signer's certificate is normally included with this option it is excluded. This will reduce the size of the signed message but the verifier must have a copy of the signers certificate available locally (passed using the -certfile option for example).</p> </li> <li> <p>-noattr</p> <p>Normally when a message is signed a set of attributes are included which include the signing time and supported symmetric algorithms. With this option they are not included.</p> </li> <li> <p>-nosmimecap</p> <p>Exclude the list of supported algorithms from signed attributes, other options such as signing time and content type are still included.</p> </li> <li> <p>-binary</p> <p>Normally the input message is converted to \"canonical\" format which is effectively using CR and LF as end of line: as required by the S/MIME specification. When this option is present no translation occurs. This is useful when handling binary data which may not be in MIME format.</p> </li> <li> <p>-crlfeol</p> <p>Normally the output file uses a single LF as end of line. When this option is present CRLF is used instead.</p> </li> <li> <p>-asciicrlf</p> <p>When signing use ASCII CRLF format canonicalisation. This strips trailing whitespace from all lines, deletes trailing blank lines at EOF and sets the encapsulated content type. This option is normally used with detached content and an output signature format of DER. This option is not normally needed when verifying as it is enabled automatically if the encapsulated content format is detected.</p> </li> <li> <p>-nodetach</p> <p>When signing a message use opaque signing: this form is more resistant to translation by mail relays but it cannot be read by mail agents that do not support S/MIME.  Without this option cleartext signing with the MIME type multipart/signed is used.</p> </li> <li> <p>-certfile file</p> <p>Allows additional certificates to be specified. When signing these will be included with the message. When verifying these will be searched for the signers certificates. The certificates should be in PEM format.</p> </li> <li> <p>-certsout file</p> <p>Any certificates contained in the message are written to file.</p> </li> <li> <p>-signer file</p> <p>A signing certificate when signing or resigning a message, this option can be used multiple times if more than one signer is required. If a message is being verified then the signers certificates will be written to this file if the verification was successful.</p> </li> <li> <p>-recip file</p> <p>When decrypting a message this specifies the recipients certificate. The certificate must match one of the recipients of the message or an error occurs.</p> <p>When encrypting a message this option may be used multiple times to specify each recipient. This form must be used if customised parameters are required (for example to specify RSA-OAEP).</p> <p>Only certificates carrying RSA, Diffie-Hellman or EC keys are supported by this option.</p> </li> <li> <p>-keyid</p> <p>Use subject key identifier to identify certificates instead of issuer name and serial number. The supplied certificate must include a subject key identifier extension. Supported by -sign and -encrypt options.</p> </li> <li> <p>-receipt_request_all, -receipt_request_first</p> <p>For -sign option include a signed receipt request. Indicate requests should be provided by all recipient or first tier recipients (those mailed directly and not from a mailing list). Ignored it -receipt_request_from is included.</p> </li> <li> <p>-receipt_request_from emailaddress</p> <p>For -sign option include a signed receipt request. Add an explicit email address where receipts should be supplied.</p> </li> <li> <p>-receipt_request_to emailaddress</p> <p>Add an explicit email address where signed receipts should be sent to. This option must but supplied if a signed receipt it requested.</p> </li> <li> <p>-receipt_request_print</p> <p>For the -verify operation print out the contents of any signed receipt requests.</p> </li> <li> <p>-secretkey key</p> <p>Specify symmetric key to use. The key must be supplied in hex format and be consistent with the algorithm used. Supported by the -EncryptedData_encrypt -EncryptedData_decrypt, -encrypt and -decrypt options. When used with -encrypt or -decrypt the supplied key is used to wrap or unwrap the content encryption key using an AES key in the KEKRecipientInfo type.</p> </li> <li> <p>-secretkeyid id</p> <p>The key identifier for the supplied symmetric key for KEKRecipientInfo type. This option must be present if the -secretkey option is used with -encrypt. With -decrypt operations the id is used to locate the relevant key if it is not supplied then an attempt is used to decrypt any KEKRecipientInfo structures.</p> </li> <li> <p>-econtent_type type</p> <p>Set the encapsulated content type to type if not supplied the Data type is used. The type argument can be any valid OID name in either text or numerical format.</p> </li> <li> <p>-inkey file</p> <p>The private key to use when signing or decrypting. This must match the corresponding certificate. If this option is not specified then the private key must be included in the certificate file specified with the -recip or -signer file. When signing this option can be used multiple times to specify successive keys.</p> </li> <li> <p>-keyopt name:opt</p> <p>For signing and encryption this option can be used multiple times to set customised parameters for the preceding key or certificate. It can currently be used to set RSA-PSS for signing, RSA-OAEP for encryption or to modify default parameters for ECDH.</p> </li> <li> <p>-passin arg</p> <p>The private key password source. For more information about the format of arg see \"Pass Phrase Options\" in openssl(1).</p> </li> <li> <p>-rand file...</p> <p>A file or files containing random data used to seed the random number generator. Multiple files can be specified separated by an OS-dependent character. The separator is ; for MS-Windows, , for OpenVMS, and : for all others.</p> </li> <li> <p>[-writerand file]</p> <p>Writes random data to the specified file upon exit. This can be used with a subsequent -rand flag.</p> </li> <li> <p>cert.pem...</p> <p>One or more certificates of message recipients: used when encrypting a message.</p> </li> <li> <p>-to, -from, -subject</p> <p>The relevant mail headers. These are included outside the signed portion of a message so they may be included manually. If signing then many S/MIME mail clients check the signers certificate's email address matches that specified in the From: address.</p> </li> <li> <p>-attime, -check_ss_sig, -crl_check, -crl_check_all, -explicit_policy, -extended_crl, -ignore_critical, -inhibit_any, -inhibit_map, -no_alt_chains, -no_check_time, -partial_chain, -policy, -policy_check, -policy_print, -purpose, -suiteB_128, -suiteB_128_only, -suiteB_192, -trusted_first, -use_deltas, -auth_level, -verify_depth, -verify_email, -verify_hostname, -verify_ip, -verify_name, -x509_strict</p> <p>Set various certificate chain validation options.

This can be produced by encrypting an already signed message: see the examples section.</p> <p>This version of the program only allows one signer per message but it will verify multiple signers on received messages. Some S/MIME clients choke if a message contains multiple signers. It is possible to sign messages \"in parallel\" by signing an already signed message.</p> <p>The options -encrypt and -decrypt reflect common usage in S/MIME clients. Strictly speaking these process CMS enveloped data: CMS encrypted data is used for other purposes.</p> <p>The -resign option uses an existing message digest when adding a new signer. This means that attributes must be present in at least one existing signer using the same message digest or this operation will fail.</p> <p>The -stream and -indef options enable streaming I/O support. As a result the encoding is BER using indefinite length constructed encoding and no longer DER. Streaming is supported for the -encrypt operation and the -sign operation if the content is not detached.</p> <p>Streaming is always used for the -sign operation with detached data but since the content is no longer part of the CMS structure the encoding remains DER.</p> <p>If the -decrypt option is used without a recipient certificate then an attempt is made to locate the recipient by trying each potential recipient in turn using the supplied private key. To thwart the MMA attack (Bleichenbacher's attack on PKCS #1 v1.5 RSA padding) all recipients are tried whether they succeed or not and if no recipients match the message is \"decrypted\" using a random key which will typically output garbage. The -debug_decrypt option can be used to disable the MMA attack protection and return an error if no recipient can be found: this option should be used with caution.

The first form doesn't work with engine-provided ciphers, because this form is processed before the configuration file is read and any ENGINEs loaded.

The output of the enc command run with the -ciphers option (that is openssl enc -ciphers) produces a list of ciphers, supported by your version of OpenSSL, including ones provided by configured engines.</p> <p>The enc program does not support authenticated encryption modes like CCM and GCM, and will not support such modes in the future. The enc interface by necessity must begin streaming output (e.g., to standard output when -out is not used) before the authentication tag could be validated, leading to the usage of enc in pipelines that begin processing untrusted data and are not capable of rolling back upon authentication failure.  The AEAD modes currently in common use also suffer from catastrophic failure of confidentiality and/or integrity upon reuse of key/iv/nonce, and since enc places the entire burden of key/iv/nonce management upon the user, the risk of exposing AEAD modes is too great to allow.  These key/iv/nonce management issues also affect other modes currently exposed in enc, but the failure modes are less extreme in these cases, and the functionality cannot be removed with a stable release branch. For bulk encryption of data, whether using authenticated encryption modes or other modes, cms(1) is recommended, as it provides a standard data format and performs the needed key/iv/nonce

It will prompt the user for the relevant field values. The actual fields prompted for and their maximum and minimum sizes are specified in the configuration file and any requested extensions.</p> <p>If the -key option is not used it will generate a new RSA private key using information specified in the configuration file.</p> </li> <li> <p>-rand file...</p> <p>A file or files containing random data used to seed the random number generator. Multiple files can be specified separated by an OS-dependent character. The separator is ; for MS-Windows, , for OpenVMS, and : for all others.</p> </li> <li> <p>[-writerand file]</p> <p>Writes random data to the specified file upon exit. This can be used with a subsequent -rand flag.</p> </li> <li> <p>-newkey arg</p> <p>This option creates a new certificate request and a new private key. The argument takes one of several forms. rsa:nbits, where nbits is the number of bits, generates an RSA key nbits in size. If nbits is omitted, i.e. -newkey rsa specified, the default key size, specified in the configuration file is used.</p> <p>All other algorithms support the -newkey alg:file form, where file may be an algorithm parameter file, created by the genpkey -genparam command or and X.509 certificate for a key with appropriate algorithm.</p> <p>param:file generates a key using the parameter file or certificate file, the algorithm is determined by the parameters. algname:file use algorithm algname and parameter file file: the two algorithms must match or an error occurs. algname just uses algorithm algname, and parameters, if necessary should be specified via -pkeyopt parameter.</p> <p>dsa:filename generates a DSA key using the parameters in the file filename. ec:filename generates EC key (usable both with ECDSA or ECDH algorithms), gost2001:filename generates GOST R 34.10-2001 key (requires ccgost engine configured in the configuration file). If just gost2001 is specified a parameter set should be specified by -pkeyopt paramset:X</p> </li> <li> <p>-pkeyopt opt:value</p> <p>Set the public key algorithm option opt to value. The precise set of options supported depends on the public key algorithm used and its implementation. See KEY GENERATION OPTIONS in the genpkey manual page for more details.</p> </li> <li> <p>-key filename</p> <p>This specifies the file to read the private key from. It also accepts PKCS#8 format private keys for PEM format files.</p> </li> <li> <p>-keyform PEM|DER</p> <p>The format of the private key file specified in the -key argument. PEM is the default.</p> </li> <li> <p>-keyout filename</p> <p>This gives the filename to write the newly created private key to. If this option is not specified then the filename present in the configuration file is used.</p> </li> <li> <p>-nodes</p> <p>If this option is specified then if a private key is created it will not be encrypted.</p> </li> <li> <p>-digest</p> <p>This specifies the message digest to sign the request. Any digest supported by the OpenSSL dgst command can be used. This overrides the digest algorithm specified in the configuration file.</p> <p>Some public key algorithms may override this choice. For instance, DSA signatures always use SHA1, GOST R 34.10 signatures always use GOST R 34.11-94 (-md_gost94), Ed25519 and Ed448 never use any digest.</p> </li> <li> <p>-config filename</p> <p>This allows an alternative configuration file to be specified. Optional; for a description of the default value, see \"COMMAND SUMMARY\" in openssl(1).</p> </li> <li> <p>-subj arg</p> <p>Sets subject name for new request or supersedes the subject name when processing a request. The arg must be formatted as /type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=.... Keyword characters may be escaped by \\ (backslash), and whitespace is retained. Empty values are permitted, but the corresponding type will not be included in the request.</p> </li> <li> <p>-multivalue-rdn</p> <p>This option causes the -subj argument to be interpreted with full support for multivalued RDNs. Example:</p> <p>/DC=org/DC=OpenSSL/DC=users/UID=123456+CN=John Doe</p> <p>If -multi-rdn is not used then the UID value is 123456+CN=John Doe.</p> </li> <li> <p>-x509</p> <p>This option outputs a self signed certificate instead of a certificate request. This is typically used to generate a test certificate or a self signed root CA. The extensions added to the certificate (if any) are specified in the configuration file. Unless specified using the set_serial option, a large random number will be used for the serial number.</p> <p>If existing request is specified with the -in option, it is converted to the self signed certificate otherwise new request is created.</p> </li> <li> <p>-days n</p> <p>When the -x509 option is being used this specifies the number of days to certify the certificate for, otherwise it is ignored. n should be a positive integer. The default is 30 days.</p> </li> <li> <p>-set_serial n</p> <p>Serial number to use when outputting a self signed certificate. This may be specified as a decimal value or a hex value if preceded by 0x.</p> </li> <li> <p>-addext ext</p> <p>Add a specific extension to the certificate (if the -x509 option is present) or certificate request.  The argument must have the form of a key=value pair as it would appear in a config file.</p> <p>This option can be given multiple times.</p> </li> <li> <p>-extensions section</p> </li> <li> <p>-reqexts section</p> <p>These options specify alternative sections to include certificate extensions (if the -x509 option is present) or certificate request extensions. This allows several different sections to be used in the same configuration file to specify requests for a variety of purposes.</p> </li> <li> <p>-precert</p> <p>A poison extension will be added to the certificate, making it a \"pre-certificate\" (see RFC6962). This can be submitted to Certificate Transparency logs in order to obtain signed certificate timestamps (SCTs). These SCTs can then be embedded into the pre-certificate as an extension, before removing the poison and signing the certificate.</p> <p>This implies the -new flag.</p> </li> <li> <p>-utf8</p> <p>This option causes field values to be interpreted as UTF8 strings, by default they are interpreted as ASCII. This means that the field values, whether prompted from a terminal or obtained from a configuration file, must be valid UTF8 strings.</p> </li> <li> <p>-nameopt option</p> <p>Option which determines how the subject or issuer names are displayed. The option argument can be a single option or multiple options separated by commas.  Alternatively the -nameopt switch may be used more than once to set multiple options. See the x509(1) manual page for details.</p> </li> <li> <p>-reqopt</p> <p>Customise the output format used with -text. The option argument can be a single option or multiple options separated by commas.</p> <p>See discussion of the  -certopt parameter in the x509(1) command.</p> </li> <li> <p>-newhdr</p> <p>Adds the word NEW to the PEM file header and footer lines on the outputted request. Some software (Netscape certificate server) and some CAs need this.</p> </li> <li> <p>-batch</p> <p>Non-interactive mode.</p> </li> <li> <p>-verbose</p> <p>Print extra details about the operations being performed.</p> </li> <li> <p>-engine id</p> <p>Specifying an engine (by its unique id string) will cause req to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine, thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default for all available algorithms.</p> </li> <li> <p>-keygen_engine id</p> <p>Specifies an engine (by its unique id string) which would be used for key generation operations.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"man1/req/#configuration-file-format","title":"CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT","text":"<p>The configuration options are specified in the req section of the configuration file.

The malicious server may then be able to violate cross-origin scripting restrictions. Thus, despite the text of RFC7671, name checks are by default enabled for DANE-EE(3) TLSA records, and can be disabled in applications where it is safe to do so.

In particular you should play with these options before submitting a bug report to an OpenSSL mailing list.</p> <p>A frequent problem when attempting to get client certificates working is that a web client complains it has no certificates or gives an empty list to choose from. This is normally because the server is not sending the clients certificate authority in its \"acceptable CA list\" when it requests a certificate. By using s_client the CA list can be viewed and checked. However, some servers only request client authentication after a specific URL is requested. To obtain the list in this case it is necessary to use the -prexit option and send an HTTP request for an appropriate page.</p> <p>If a certificate is specified on the command line using the -cert option it will not be used unless the server specifically requests a client certificate.

This permits single pass processing of data without the need to hold the entire contents in memory, potentially supporting very large files. Streaming is automatically set for S/MIME signing with detached data if the output format is SMIME it is currently off by default for all other operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>-noindef</p> <p>Disable streaming I/O where it would produce and indefinite length constructed encoding. This option currently has no effect. In future streaming will be enabled by default on all relevant operations and this option will disable it.</p> </li> <li> <p>-content filename</p> <p>This specifies a file containing the detached content, this is only useful with the -verify command. This is only usable if the PKCS#7 structure is using the detached signature form where the content is not included. This option will override any content if the input format is S/MIME and it uses the multipart/signed MIME content type.</p> </li> <li> <p>-text</p> <p>This option adds plain text (text/plain) MIME headers to the supplied message if encrypting or signing. If decrypting or verifying it strips off text headers: if the decrypted or verified message is not of MIME type text/plain then an error occurs.</p> </li> <li> <p>-CAfile file</p> <p>A file containing trusted CA certificates, only used with -verify.</p> </li> <li> <p>-CApath dir</p> <p>A directory containing trusted CA certificates, only used with -verify.

If not present then the default digest algorithm for the signing key will be used (usually SHA1).</p> </li> <li> <p>-cipher</p> <p>The encryption algorithm to use. For example DES  (56 bits) - -des, triple DES (168 bits) - -des3, EVP_get_cipherbyname() function) can also be used preceded by a dash, for example -aes-128-cbc. See enc for list of ciphers supported by your version of OpenSSL.</p> <p>If not specified triple DES is used. Only used with -encrypt.</p> </li> <li> <p>-nointern</p> <p>When verifying a message normally certificates (if any) included in the message are searched for the signing certificate. With this option only the certificates specified in the -certfile option are used. The supplied certificates can still be used as untrusted CAs however.</p> </li> <li> <p>-noverify</p> <p>Do not verify the signers certificate of a signed message.</p> </li> <li> <p>-nochain</p> <p>Do not do chain verification of signers certificates: that is don't use the certificates in the signed message as untrusted CAs.</p> </li> <li> <p>-nosigs</p> <p>Don't try to verify the signatures on the message.</p> </li> <li> <p>-nocerts</p> <p>When signing a message the signer's certificate is normally included with this option it is excluded. This will reduce the size of the signed message but the verifier must have a copy of the signers certificate available locally (passed using the -certfile option for example).</p> </li> <li> <p>-noattr</p> <p>Normally when a message is signed a set of attributes are included which include the signing time and supported symmetric algorithms. With this option they are not included.</p> </li> <li> <p>-binary</p> <p>Normally the input message is converted to \"canonical\" format which is effectively using CR and LF as end of line: as required by the S/MIME specification. When this option is present no translation occurs. This is useful when handling binary data which may not be in MIME format.</p> </li> <li> <p>-crlfeol</p> <p>Normally the output file uses a single LF as end of line. When this option is present CRLF is used instead.</p> </li> <li> <p>-nodetach</p> <p>When signing a message use opaque signing: this form is more resistant to translation by mail relays but it cannot be read by mail agents that do not support S/MIME.  Without this option cleartext signing with the MIME type multipart/signed is used.</p> </li> <li> <p>-certfile file</p> <p>Allows additional certificates to be specified. When signing these will be included with the message. When verifying these will be searched for the signers certificates. The certificates should be in PEM format.</p> </li> <li> <p>-signer file</p> <p>A signing certificate when signing or resigning a message, this option can be used multiple times if more than one signer is required. If a message is being verified then the signers certificates will be written to this file if the verification was successful.</p> </li> <li> <p>-recip file</p> <p>The recipients certificate when decrypting a message. This certificate must match one of the recipients of the message or an error occurs.</p> </li> <li> <p>-inkey file_or_id</p> <p>The private key to use when signing or decrypting. This must match the corresponding certificate. If this option is not specified then the private key must be included in the certificate file specified with the -recip or -signer file. When signing this option can be used multiple times to specify successive keys. If no engine is used, the argument is taken as a file; if an engine is specified, the argument is given to the engine as a key identifier.</p> </li> <li> <p>-passin arg</p> <p>The private key password source.

Here is a brief description of the protocol:</p> <ol> <li>The TSA client computes a one-way hash value for a data file and sends the hash to the TSA.</li> <li>The TSA attaches the current date and time to the received hash value, signs them and sends the timestamp token back to the client. By creating this token the TSA certifies the existence of the original data file at the time of response generation.</li> <li>The TSA client receives the timestamp token and verifies the signature on it. It also checks if the token contains the same hash value that it had sent to the TSA.</li> </ol> <p>There is one DER encoded protocol data unit defined for transporting  a timestamp request to the TSA and one for sending the timestamp response back to the client. The ts command has three main functions: creating a timestamp request based on a data file, creating a timestamp response based on a request, verifying if a response corresponds to a particular request or a data file.</p> <p>There is no support for sending the requests/responses automatically over HTTP or TCP yet as suggested in RFC 3161.

This allows all the problems with a certificate chain to be determined.</p> <p>The verify operation consists of a number of separate steps.</p> <p>Firstly a certificate chain is built up starting from the supplied certificate and ending in the root CA. It is an error if the whole chain cannot be built up. The chain is built up by looking up the issuers certificate of the current certificate. If a certificate is found which is its own issuer it is assumed to be the root CA.</p> <p>The process of 'looking up the issuers certificate' itself involves a number of steps. After all certificates whose subject name matches the issuer name of the current certificate are subject to further tests. The relevant authority key identifier components of the current certificate (if present) must match the subject key identifier (if present) and issuer and serial number of the candidate issuer, in addition the keyUsage extension of the candidate issuer (if present) must permit certificate signing.</p> <p>The lookup first looks in the list of untrusted certificates and if no match is found the remaining lookups are from the trusted certificates. The root CA is always looked up in the trusted certificate list: if the certificate to verify is a root certificate then an exact match must be found in the trusted list.</p> <p>The second operation is to check every untrusted certificate's extensions for consistency with the supplied purpose. If the -purpose option is not included then no checks are done. The supplied or \"leaf\" certificate must have extensions compatible with the supplied purpose and all other certificates must also be valid CA certificates. The precise extensions required are described in more detail in the CERTIFICATE EXTENSIONS section of the x509 utility.</p> <p>The third operation is to check the trust settings on the root CA. The root CA should be trusted for the supplied purpose. For compatibility with previous versions of OpenSSL, a certificate with no trust settings is considered to be valid for all purposes.</p> <p>The final operation is to check the validity of the certificate chain. For each element in the chain, including the root CA certificate, the validity period as specified by the <code>notBefore</code> and <code>notAfter</code> fields is checked against the current system time. The -attime flag may be used to use a reference time other than \"now.\" The certificate signature is checked as well (except for the signature of the typically self-signed root CA certificate, which is verified only if the -check_ss_sig option is given).</p> <p>If all operations complete successfully then certificate is considered valid.

An ASYNC_WAIT_CTX object represents an asynchronous \"session\", i.e. a related set of crypto operations. For example in SSL terms this would have a one-to-one correspondence with an SSL connection.</p> <p>Application code must create an ASYNC_WAIT_CTX using the ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_new() function prior to calling ASYNC_start_job() (see ASYNC_start_job(3)). When the job is started it is associated with the ASYNC_WAIT_CTX for the duration of that job. An ASYNC_WAIT_CTX should only be used for one ASYNC_JOB at any one time, but can be reused after an ASYNC_JOB has finished for a subsequent ASYNC_JOB. When the session is complete (e.g. the SSL connection is closed), application code cleans up with ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_free().</p> <p>ASYNC_WAIT_CTXs can have \"wait\" file descriptors associated with them. Calling ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_all_fds() and passing in a pointer to an ASYNC_WAIT_CTX in the ctx parameter will return the wait file descriptors associated with that job in *fd. The number of file descriptors returned will be stored in *numfds. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that sufficient memory has been allocated in *fd to receive all the file descriptors. Calling ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_all_fds() with a NULL fd value will return no file descriptors but will still populate *numfds. Therefore, application code is typically expected to call this function twice: once to get the number of fds, and then again when sufficient memory has been allocated. If only one asynchronous engine is being used then normally this call will only ever return one fd. If multiple asynchronous engines are being used then more could be returned.</p> <p>The function ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_changed_fds() can be used to detect if any fds have changed since the last call time ASYNC_start_job() returned an ASYNC_PAUSE result (or since the ASYNC_WAIT_CTX was created if no ASYNC_PAUSE result has been received). The numaddfds and numdelfds parameters will be populated with the number of fds added or deleted respectively. *addfd and *delfd will be populated with the list of added and deleted fds respectively. Similarly to ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_all_fds() either of these can be NULL, but if they are not NULL then the caller is responsible for ensuring sufficient memory is allocated.</p> <p>Implementors of async aware code (e.g. engines) are encouraged to return a stable fd for the lifetime of the ASYNC_WAIT_CTX in order to reduce the \"churn\" of regularly changing fds - although no guarantees of this are provided to applications.</p> <p>Applications can wait for the file descriptor to be ready for \"read\" using a system function call such as select or poll (being ready for \"read\" indicates that the job should be resumed). If no file descriptor is made available then an application will have to periodically \"poll\" the job by attempting to restart it to see if it is ready to continue.</p> <p>Async aware code (e.g. engines) can get the current ASYNC_WAIT_CTX from the job via ASYNC_get_wait_ctx(3) and provide a file descriptor to use for waiting on by calling ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_set_wait_fd(). Typically this would be done by an engine immediately prior to calling ASYNC_pause_job() and not by end user code. An existing association with a file descriptor can be obtained using ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_fd() and cleared using ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_clear_fd(). Both of these functions requires a key value which is unique to the async aware code.  This could be any unique value but a good candidate might be the ENGINE * for the engine. The custom_data parameter can be any value, and will be returned in a subsequent call to ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_fd(). The ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_set_wait_fd() function also expects a pointer to a \"cleanup\" routine. This can be NULL but if provided will automatically get called when the ASYNC_WAIT_CTX is freed, and gives the engine the opportunity to close the fd or any other resources. Note: The \"cleanup\" routine does not get called if the fd is cleared directly via a call to ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_clear_fd().</p> <p>An example of typical usage might be an async capable engine. User code would initiate cryptographic operations. The engine would initiate those operations asynchronously and then call ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_set_wait_fd() followed by ASYNC_pause_job() to return control to the user code. The user code can then perform other tasks or wait for the job to be ready by calling \"select\" or other similar function on the wait file descriptor. The engine can signal to the user code that the job should be resumed by making the wait file descriptor \"readable\". Once resumed the engine should clear the wake signal on the wait file descriptor.</p>"},{"location":"man3/ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_new/#return-values","title":"RETURN VALUES","text":"<p>ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_new() returns a pointer to the newly allocated ASYNC_WAIT_CTX or NULL on error.</p> <p>ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_set_wait_fd, ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_fd, ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_all_fds, ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_changed_fds and ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_clear_fd all return 1 on success or 0 on error.</p>"},{"location":"man3/ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_new/#notes","title":"NOTES","text":"<p>On Windows platforms the openssl/async.h header is dependent on some of the types customarily made available by including windows.h.

This represents code that can be started and executes until some event occurs. At that point the code can be paused and control returns to user code until some subsequent event indicates that the job can be resumed.</p> <p>The creation of an ASYNC_JOB is a relatively expensive operation. Therefore, for efficiency reasons, jobs can be created up front and reused many times. They are held in a pool until they are needed, at which point they are removed from the pool, used, and then returned to the pool when the job completes. If the user application is multi-threaded, then ASYNC_init_thread() may be called for each thread that will initiate asynchronous jobs. Before user code exits per-thread resources need to be cleaned up. This will normally occur automatically (see OPENSSL_init_crypto(3)) but may be explicitly initiated by using ASYNC_cleanup_thread(). No asynchronous jobs must be outstanding for the thread when ASYNC_cleanup_thread() is called. Failing to ensure this will result in memory leaks.</p> <p>The max_size argument limits the number of ASYNC_JOBs that will be held in the pool. If max_size is set to 0 then no upper limit is set. When an ASYNC_JOB is needed but there are none available in the pool already then one will be automatically created, as long as the total of ASYNC_JOBs managed by the pool does not exceed max_size. When the pool is first initialised init_size ASYNC_JOBs will be created immediately. If ASYNC_init_thread() is not called before the pool is first used then it will be called automatically with a max_size of 0 (no upper limit) and an init_size of 0 (no ASYNC_JOBs created up front).</p> <p>An asynchronous job is started by calling the ASYNC_start_job() function. Initially *job should be NULL. ctx should point to an ASYNC_WAIT_CTX object created through the ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_new(3) function. ret should point to a location where the return value of the asynchronous function should be stored on completion of the job. func represents the function that should be started asynchronously. The data pointed to by args and of size size will be copied and then passed as an argument to func when the job starts. ASYNC_start_job will return one of the following values:</p> <ul> <li> <p>ASYNC_ERR</p> <p>An error occurred trying to start the job. Check the OpenSSL error queue (e.g. see ERR_print_errors(3)) for more details.</p> </li> <li> <p>ASYNC_NO_JOBS</p> <p>There are no jobs currently available in the pool. This call can be retried again at a later time.</p> </li> <li> <p>ASYNC_PAUSE</p> <p>The job was successfully started but was \"paused\" before it completed (see ASYNC_pause_job() below). A handle to the job is placed in *job. Other work can be performed (if desired) and the job restarted at a later time. To restart a job call ASYNC_start_job() again passing the job handle in *job. The func, args and size parameters will be ignored when restarting a job. When restarting a job ASYNC_start_job() must be called from the same thread that the job was originally started from.</p> </li> <li> <p>ASYNC_FINISH</p> <p>The job completed. *job will be NULL and the return value from func will be placed in *ret.</p> </li> </ul> <p>At any one time there can be a maximum of one job actively running per thread (you can have many that are paused). ASYNC_get_current_job() can be used to get a pointer to the currently executing ASYNC_JOB. If no job is currently executing then this will return NULL.</p> <p>If executing within the context of a job (i.e. having been called directly or indirectly by the function \"func\" passed as an argument to ASYNC_start_job()) then ASYNC_pause_job() will immediately return control to the calling application with ASYNC_PAUSE returned from the ASYNC_start_job() call. A subsequent call to ASYNC_start_job passing in the relevant ASYNC_JOB in the *job parameter will resume execution from the ASYNC_pause_job() call. If ASYNC_pause_job() is called whilst not within the context of a job then no action is taken and ASYNC_pause_job() returns immediately.</p> <p>ASYNC_get_wait_ctx() can be used to get a pointer to the ASYNC_WAIT_CTX for the job. ASYNC_WAIT_CTXs can have a \"wait\" file descriptor associated with them. Applications can wait for the file descriptor to be ready for \"read\" using a system function call such as select or poll (being ready for \"read\" indicates that the job should be resumed). If no file descriptor is made available then an application will have to periodically \"poll\" the job by attempting to restart it to see if it is ready to continue.</p> <p>An example of typical usage might be an async capable engine. User code would initiate cryptographic operations. The engine would initiate those operations asynchronously and then call ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_set_wait_fd(3) followed by ASYNC_pause_job() to return control to the user code. The user code can then perform other tasks or wait for the job to be ready by calling \"select\" or other similar function on the wait file descriptor. The engine can signal to the user code that the job should be resumed by making the wait file descriptor \"readable\". Once resumed the engine should clear the wake signal on the wait file descriptor.</p> <p>The ASYNC_block_pause() function will prevent the currently active job from pausing. The block will remain in place until a subsequent call to ASYNC_unblock_pause(). These functions can be nested, e.g. if you call ASYNC_block_pause() twice then you must call ASYNC_unblock_pause() twice in order to re-enable pausing. If these functions are called while there is no currently active job then they have no effect. This functionality can be useful to avoid deadlock scenarios. For example during the execution of an ASYNC_JOB an application acquires a lock. It then calls some cryptographic function which invokes ASYNC_pause_job(). This returns control back to the code that created the ASYNC_JOB. If that code then attempts to acquire the same lock before resuming the original job then a deadlock can occur. By calling ASYNC_block_pause() immediately after acquiring the lock and ASYNC_unblock_pause() immediately before releasing it then this situation cannot occur.</p> <p>Some platforms cannot support async operations. The ASYNC_is_capable() function can be used to detect whether the current platform is async capable or not.</p>"},{"location":"man3/ASYNC_start_job/#return-values","title":"RETURN VALUES","text":"<p>ASYNC_init_thread returns 1 on success or 0 otherwise.</p> <p>ASYNC_start_job returns one of ASYNC_ERR, ASYNC_NO_JOBS, ASYNC_PAUSE or ASYNC_FINISH as described above.</p> <p>ASYNC_pause_job returns 0 if an error occurred or 1 on success.

It uses a variable size key, but typically, 128 bit (16 byte) keys are considered good for strong encryption.  Blowfish can be used in the same modes as DES (see des_modes(7)).  Blowfish is currently one of the faster block ciphers.  It is quite a bit faster than DES, and much faster than IDEA or RC2.</p> <p>Blowfish consists of a key setup phase and the actual encryption or decryption phase.</p> <p>BF_set_key() sets up the BF_KEY key using the len bytes long key at data.</p> <p>BF_ecb_encrypt() is the basic Blowfish encryption and decryption function. It encrypts or decrypts the first 64 bits of in using the key key, putting the result in out.  enc decides if encryption (BF_ENCRYPT) or decryption (BF_DECRYPT) shall be performed.  The vector pointed at by in and out must be 64 bits in length, no less.  If they are larger, everything after the first 64 bits is ignored.</p> <p>The mode functions BF_cbc_encrypt(), BF_cfb64_encrypt() and BF_ofb64_encrypt() all operate on variable length data.  They all take an initialization vector ivec which needs to be passed along into the next call of the same function for the same message.  ivec may be initialized with anything, but the recipient needs to know what it was initialized with, or it won't be able to decrypt.  Some programs and protocols simplify this, like SSH, where ivec is simply initialized to zero. BF_cbc_encrypt() operates on data that is a multiple of 8 bytes long, while BF_cfb64_encrypt() and BF_ofb64_encrypt() are used to encrypt a variable number of bytes (the amount does not have to be an exact multiple of 8).  The purpose of the latter two is to simulate stream ciphers, and therefore, they need the parameter num, which is a pointer to an integer where the current offset in ivec is stored between calls.  This integer must be initialized to zero when ivec is initialized.</p> <p>BF_cbc_encrypt() is the Cipher Block Chaining function for Blowfish.  It encrypts or decrypts the 64 bits chunks of in using the key schedule, putting the result in out.  enc decides if encryption (BF_ENCRYPT) or decryption (BF_DECRYPT) shall be performed.  ivec must point at an 8 byte long initialization vector.</p> <p>BF_cfb64_encrypt() is the CFB mode for Blowfish with 64 bit feedback. It encrypts or decrypts the bytes in in using the key schedule, putting the result in out.  enc decides if encryption (BF_ENCRYPT) or decryption (BF_DECRYPT) shall be performed.  ivec must point at an 8 byte long initialization vector. num must point at an integer which must be initially zero.</p> <p>BF_ofb64_encrypt() is the OFB mode for Blowfish with 64 bit feedback. It uses the same parameters as BF_cfb64_encrypt(), which must be initialized the same way.</p> <p>BF_encrypt() and BF_decrypt() are the lowest level functions for Blowfish encryption.  They encrypt/decrypt the first 64 bits of the vector pointed by data, using the key key.  These functions should not be used unless you implement 'modes' of Blowfish.  The alternative is to use BF_ecb_encrypt(). If you still want to use these functions, you should be aware that they take each 32-bit chunk in host-byte order, which is little-endian on little-endian platforms and big-endian on big-endian ones.</p>"},{"location":"man3/BF_encrypt/#return-values","title":"RETURN VALUES","text":"<p>None of the functions presented here return any value.</p>"},{"location":"man3/BF_encrypt/#note","title":"NOTE","text":"<p>Applications should use the higher level functions EVP_EncryptInit(3) etc. instead of calling these functions directly.</p>"},{"location":"man3/BF_encrypt/#see-also","title":"SEE ALSO","text":"<p>EVP_EncryptInit(3), des_modes(7)</p>"},{"location":"man3/BF_encrypt/#copyright","title":"COPYRIGHT","text":"<p>Copyright 2000-2020 The OpenSSL Project Authors.

For example if a call to BIO_read_ex() on a socket BIO returns 0 and BIO_should_retry() is false then the cause will be that the connection closed. A similar condition on a file BIO will mean that it has reached EOF. Some BIO types may place additional information on the error queue. For more details see the individual BIO type manual pages.</p> <p>If the underlying I/O structure is in a blocking mode almost all current BIO types will not request a retry, because the underlying I/O calls will not. If the application knows that the BIO type will never signal a retry then it need not call BIO_should_retry() after a failed BIO I/O call. This is typically done with file BIOs.</p> <p>SSL BIOs are the only current exception to this rule: they can request a retry even if the underlying I/O structure is blocking, if a handshake occurs during a call to BIO_read(). An application can retry the failed call immediately or avoid this situation by setting SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY on the underlying SSL structure.</p> <p>While an application may retry a failed non blocking call immediately this is likely to be very inefficient because the call will fail repeatedly until data can be processed or is available. An application will normally wait until the necessary condition is satisfied. How this is done depends on the underlying I/O structure.</p> <p>For example if the cause is ultimately a socket and BIO_should_read() is true then a call to select() may be made to wait until data is available and then retry the BIO operation. By combining the retry conditions of several non blocking BIOs in a single select() call it is possible to service several BIOs in a single thread, though the performance may be poor if SSL BIOs are present because long delays can occur during the initial handshake process.</p> <p>It is possible for a BIO to block indefinitely if the underlying I/O structure cannot process or return any data. This depends on the behaviour of the platforms I/O functions. This is often not desirable: one solution is to use non blocking I/O and use a timeout on the select() (or equivalent) call.</p>"},{"location":"man3/BIO_should_retry/#bugs","title":"BUGS","text":"<p>The OpenSSL ASN1 functions cannot gracefully deal with non blocking I/O: that is they cannot retry after a partial read or write.

In addition, CRYPTO_EX_INDEX_APP is reserved for applications to use this facility for their own structures.</p> <p>The API described here is used by OpenSSL to manipulate exdata for specific structures.  Since the application data can be anything at all it is passed and retrieved as a void * type.</p> <p>The CRYPTO_EX_DATA type is opaque.  To initialize the exdata part of a structure, call CRYPTO_new_ex_data(). This is only necessary for CRYPTO_EX_INDEX_APP objects.</p> <p>Exdata types are identified by an index, an integer guaranteed to be unique within structures for the lifetime of the program.  Applications using exdata typically call CRYPTO_get_ex_new_index at startup, and store the result in a global variable, or write a wrapper function to provide lazy evaluation.  The class_index should be one of the CRYPTO_EX_INDEX_xxx values. The argl and argp parameters are saved to be passed to the callbacks but are otherwise not used.  In order to transparently manipulate exdata, three callbacks must be provided. The semantics of those callbacks are described below.</p> <p>When copying or releasing objects with exdata, the callback functions are called in increasing order of their index value.</p> <p>If a dynamic library can be unloaded, it should call CRYPTO_free_ex_index() when this is done. This will replace the callbacks with no-ops so that applications don't crash.  Any existing exdata will be leaked.</p> <p>To set or get the exdata on an object, the appropriate type-specific routine must be used.  This is because the containing structure is opaque and the CRYPTO_EX_DATA field is not accessible.  In both API's, the idx parameter should be an already-created index value.</p> <p>When setting exdata, the pointer specified with a particular index is saved, and returned on a subsequent \"get\" call.  If the application is going to release the data, it must make sure to set a NULL value at the index, to avoid likely double-free crashes.</p> <p>The function CRYPTO_free_ex_data is used to free all exdata attached to a structure. The appropriate type-specific routine must be used. The class_index identifies the structure type, the obj is a pointer to the actual structure, and r is a pointer to the structure's exdata field.</p>"},{"location":"man3/CRYPTO_get_ex_new_index/#callback-functions","title":"Callback Functions","text":"<p>This section describes how the callback functions are used. Applications that are defining their own exdata using CYPRTO_EX_INDEX_APP must call them as described here.</p> <p>When a structure is initially allocated (such as RSA_new()) then the new_func() is called for every defined index. There is no requirement that the entire parent, or containing, structure has been set up. The new_func() is typically used only to allocate memory to store the exdata, and perhaps an \"initialized\" flag within that memory. The exdata value should be set by calling CRYPTO_set_ex_data().</p> <p>When a structure is free'd (such as SSL_CTX_free()) then the free_func() is called for every defined index.  Again, the state of the parent structure is not guaranteed.  The free_func() may be called with a NULL pointer.</p> <p>Both new_func() and free_func() take the same parameters. The parent is the pointer to the structure that contains the exdata. The ptr is the current exdata item; for new_func() this will typically be NULL.  The r parameter is a pointer to the exdata field of the object. The idx is the index and is the value returned when the callbacks were initially registered via CRYPTO_get_ex_new_index() and can be used if the same callback handles different types of exdata.</p> <p>dup_func() is called when a structure is being copied.  This is only done for SSL, SSL_SESSION, EC_KEY objects and BIO chains via BIO_dup_chain().  The to and from parameters are pointers to the destination and source CRYPTO_EX_DATA structures, respectively.  The from_d parameter needs to be cast to a void **pptr as the API has currently the wrong signature; that will be changed in a future version.  The *pptr is a pointer to the source exdata. When the dup_func() returns, the value in *pptr is copied to the destination ex_data.  If the pointer contained in *pptr is not modified by the dup_func(), then both to and from will point to the same data. The idx, argl and argp parameters are as described for the other two callbacks.  If the dup_func() returns 0 the whole CRYPTO_dup_ex_data() will fail.</p>"},{"location":"man3/CRYPTO_get_ex_new_index/#return-values","title":"RETURN VALUES","text":"<p>CRYPTO_get_ex_new_index() returns a new index or -1 on failure.</p> <p>CRYPTO_free_ex_index() and CRYPTO_set_ex_data() return 1 on success or 0 on failure.</p> <p>CRYPTO_get_ex_data() returns the application data or NULL on failure; note that NULL may be a valid value.</p> <p>dup_func() should return 0 for failure and 1 for success.</p>"},{"location":"man3/CRYPTO_get_ex_new_index/#copyright","title":"COPYRIGHT","text":"<p>Copyright 2015-2019 The OpenSSL Project Authors.

These macros define typesafe inline functions that wrap around the utility OPENSSL_sk_ API. In the description here, TYPE is used as a placeholder for any of the OpenSSL datatypes, such as X509.</p> <p>STACK_OF() returns the name for a stack of the specified TYPE. DEFINE_STACK_OF() creates set of functions for a stack of TYPE. This will mean that type TYPE is stored in each stack, the type is referenced by STACK_OF(TYPE) and each function name begins with sk_TYPE_. For example:</p> <pre><code>TYPE *sk_TYPE_value(STACK_OF(TYPE) *sk, int idx);\n</code></pre> <p>DEFINE_STACK_OF_CONST() is identical to DEFINE_STACK_OF() except each element is constant. For example:</p> <pre><code>const TYPE *sk_TYPE_value(STACK_OF(TYPE) *sk, int idx);\n</code></pre> <p>DEFINE_SPECIAL_STACK_OF() defines a stack of TYPE but each function uses FUNCNAME in the function name. For example:</p> <pre><code>TYPE *sk_FUNCNAME_value(STACK_OF(TYPE) *sk, int idx);\n</code></pre> <p>DEFINE_SPECIAL_STACK_OF_CONST() is similar except that each element is constant:</p> <pre><code>const TYPE *sk_FUNCNAME_value(STACK_OF(TYPE) *sk, int idx);\n</code></pre> <p>sk_TYPE_num() returns the number of elements in sk or -1 if sk is NULL.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_value() returns element idx in sk, where idx starts at zero. If idx is out of range then NULL is returned.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_new() allocates a new empty stack using comparison function compare. If compare is NULL then no comparison function is used. This function is equivalent to sk_TYPE_new_reserve(compare, 0).</p> <p>sk_TYPE_new_null() allocates a new empty stack with no comparison function. This function is equivalent to sk_TYPE_new_reserve(NULL, 0).</p> <p>sk_TYPE_reserve() allocates additional memory in the sk structure such that the next n calls to sk_TYPE_insert(), sk_TYPE_push() or sk_TYPE_unshift() will not fail or cause memory to be allocated or reallocated. If n is zero, any excess space allocated in the sk structure is freed. On error sk is unchanged.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_new_reserve() allocates a new stack. The new stack will have additional memory allocated to hold n elements if n is positive. The next n calls to sk_TYPE_insert(), sk_TYPE_push() or sk_TYPE_unshift() will not fail or cause memory to be allocated or reallocated. If n is zero or less than zero, no memory is allocated. sk_TYPE_new_reserve() also sets the comparison function compare to the newly created stack. If compare is NULL then no comparison function is used.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_set_cmp_func() sets the comparison function of sk to compare. The previous comparison function is returned or NULL if there was no previous comparison function.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_free() frees up the sk structure. It does not free up any elements of sk. After this call sk is no longer valid.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_zero() sets the number of elements in sk to zero. It does not free sk so after this call sk is still valid.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_pop_free() frees up all elements of sk and sk itself. The free function freefunc() is called on each element to free it.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_delete() deletes element i from sk. It returns the deleted element or NULL if i is out of range.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_delete_ptr() deletes element matching ptr from sk. It returns the deleted element or NULL if no element matching ptr was found.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_insert() inserts ptr into sk at position idx. Any existing elements at or after idx are moved downwards. If idx is out of range the new element is appended to sk. sk_TYPE_insert() either returns the number of elements in sk after the new element is inserted or zero if an error (such as memory allocation failure) occurred.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_push() appends ptr to sk it is equivalent to:</p> <pre><code>sk_TYPE_insert(sk, ptr, -1);\n</code></pre> <p>sk_TYPE_unshift() inserts ptr at the start of sk it is equivalent to:</p> <pre><code>sk_TYPE_insert(sk, ptr, 0);\n</code></pre> <p>sk_TYPE_pop() returns and removes the last element from sk.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_shift() returns and removes the first element from sk.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_set() sets element idx of sk to ptr replacing the current element. The new element value is returned or NULL if an error occurred: this will only happen if sk is NULL or idx is out of range.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_find() searches sk for the element ptr.  In the case where no comparison function has been specified, the function performs a linear search for a pointer equal to ptr. The index of the first matching element is returned or -1 if there is no match. In the case where a comparison function has been specified, sk is sorted then sk_TYPE_find() returns the index of a matching element or -1 if there is no match. Note that, in this case, the matching element returned is not guaranteed to be the first; the comparison function will usually compare the values pointed to rather than the pointers themselves and the order of elements in sk could change.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_find_ex() operates like sk_TYPE_find() except when a comparison function has been specified and no matching element is found. Instead of returning -1, sk_TYPE_find_ex() returns the index of the element either before or after the location where ptr would be if it were present in sk.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_sort() sorts sk using the supplied comparison function.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_is_sorted() returns 1 if sk is sorted and 0 otherwise.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_dup() returns a copy of sk. Note the pointers in the copy are identical to the original.</p> <p>sk_TYPE_deep_copy() returns a new stack where each element has been copied. Copying is performed by the supplied copyfunc() and freeing by freefunc(). The function freefunc() is only called if an error occurs.</p>"},{"location":"man3/DEFINE_STACK_OF/#notes","title":"NOTES","text":"<p>Care should be taken when accessing stacks in multi-threaded environments.

The first is the generation of a DES_key_schedule from a key, the second is the actual encryption.  A DES key is of type DES_cblock. This type consists of 8 bytes with odd parity.  The least significant bit in each byte is the parity bit.  The key schedule is an expanded form of the key; it is used to speed the encryption process.</p> <p>DES_random_key() generates a random key.  The random generator must be seeded when calling this function. If the automatic seeding or reseeding of the OpenSSL CSPRNG fails due to external circumstances (see RAND(7)), the operation will fail. If the function fails, 0 is returned.</p> <p>Before a DES key can be used, it must be converted into the architecture dependent DES_key_schedule via the DES_set_key_checked() or DES_set_key_unchecked() function.</p> <p>DES_set_key_checked() will check that the key passed is of odd parity and is not a weak or semi-weak key.  If the parity is wrong, then -1 is returned.  If the key is a weak key, then -2 is returned.  If an error is returned, the key schedule is not generated.</p> <p>DES_set_key() works like DES_set_key_checked() if the DES_check_key flag is nonzero, otherwise like DES_set_key_unchecked().  These functions are available for compatibility; it is recommended to use a function that does not depend on a global variable.</p> <p>DES_set_odd_parity() sets the parity of the passed key to odd.</p> <p>DES_is_weak_key() returns 1 if the passed key is a weak key, 0 if it is ok.</p> <p>The following routines mostly operate on an input and output stream of _DES_cblock_s.</p> <p>DES_ecb_encrypt() is the basic DES encryption routine that encrypts or decrypts a single 8-byte DES_cblock in electronic code book (ECB) mode.  It always transforms the input data, pointed to by input, into the output data, pointed to by the output argument. If the encrypt argument is nonzero (DES_ENCRYPT), the input (cleartext) is encrypted in to the output (ciphertext) using the key_schedule specified by the schedule argument, previously set via DES_set_key. If encrypt is zero (DES_DECRYPT), the input (now ciphertext) is decrypted into the output (now cleartext).  Input and output may overlap.  DES_ecb_encrypt() does not return a value.</p> <p>DES_ecb3_encrypt() encrypts/decrypts the input block by using three-key Triple-DES encryption in ECB mode.  This involves encrypting the input with ks1, decrypting with the key schedule ks2, and then encrypting with ks3.  This routine greatly reduces the chances of brute force breaking of DES and has the advantage of if ks1, ks2 and ks3 are the same, it is equivalent to just encryption using ECB mode and ks1 as the key.</p> <p>The macro DES_ecb2_encrypt() is provided to perform two-key Triple-DES encryption by using ks1 for the final encryption.</p> <p>DES_ncbc_encrypt() encrypts/decrypts using the cipher-block-chaining (CBC) mode of DES.  If the encrypt argument is nonzero, the routine cipher-block-chain encrypts the cleartext data pointed to by the input argument into the ciphertext pointed to by the output argument, using the key schedule provided by the schedule argument, and initialization vector provided by the ivec argument.  If the length argument is not an integral multiple of eight bytes, the last block is copied to a temporary area and zero filled.  The output is always an integral multiple of eight bytes.</p> <p>DES_xcbc_encrypt() is RSA's DESX mode of DES.  It uses inw and outw to 'whiten' the encryption.  inw and outw are secret (unlike the iv) and are as such, part of the key.  So the key is sort of 24 bytes.  This is much better than CBC DES.</p> <p>DES_ede3_cbc_encrypt() implements outer triple CBC DES encryption with three keys. This means that each DES operation inside the CBC mode is <code>C=E(ks3,D(ks2,E(ks1,M)))</code>.  This mode is used by SSL.</p> <p>The DES_ede2_cbc_encrypt() macro implements two-key Triple-DES by reusing ks1 for the final encryption.  <code>C=E(ks1,D(ks2,E(ks1,M)))</code>. This form of Triple-DES is used by the RSAREF library.</p> <p>DES_pcbc_encrypt() encrypts/decrypts using the propagating cipher block chaining mode used by Kerberos v4. Its parameters are the same as DES_ncbc_encrypt().</p> <p>DES_cfb_encrypt() encrypts/decrypts using cipher feedback mode.  This method takes an array of characters as input and outputs an array of characters.  It does not require any padding to 8 character groups. Note: the ivec variable is changed and the new changed value needs to be passed to the next call to this function.  Since this function runs a complete DES ECB encryption per numbits, this function is only suggested for use when sending a small number of characters.</p> <p>DES_cfb64_encrypt() implements CFB mode of DES with 64-bit feedback.  Why is this useful you ask?  Because this routine will allow you to encrypt an arbitrary number of bytes, without 8 byte padding.  Each call to this routine will encrypt the input bytes to output and then update ivec and num.  num contains 'how far' we are though ivec.  If this does not make much sense, read more about CFB mode of DES.</p> <p>DES_ede3_cfb64_encrypt() and DES_ede2_cfb64_encrypt() is the same as DES_cfb64_encrypt() except that Triple-DES is used.</p> <p>DES_ofb_encrypt() encrypts using output feedback mode.  This method takes an array of characters as input and outputs an array of characters.  It does not require any padding to 8 character groups. Note: the ivec variable is changed and the new changed value needs to be passed to the next call to this function.  Since this function runs a complete DES ECB encryption per numbits, this function is only suggested for use when sending a small number of characters.</p> <p>DES_ofb64_encrypt() is the same as DES_cfb64_encrypt() using Output Feed Back mode.</p> <p>DES_ede3_ofb64_encrypt() and DES_ede2_ofb64_encrypt() is the same as DES_ofb64_encrypt(), using Triple-DES.</p> <p>The following functions are included in the DES library for compatibility with the MIT Kerberos library.</p> <p>DES_cbc_cksum() produces an 8 byte checksum based on the input stream (via CBC encryption).  The last 4 bytes of the checksum are returned and the complete 8 bytes are placed in output. This function is used by Kerberos v4.  Other applications should use EVP_DigestInit(3) etc. instead.</p> <p>DES_quad_cksum() is a Kerberos v4 function.  It returns a 4 byte checksum from the input bytes.  The algorithm can be iterated over the input, depending on out_count, 1, 2, 3 or 4 times.  If output is non-NULL, the 8 bytes generated by each pass are written into output.</p> <p>The following are DES-based transformations:</p> <p>DES_fcrypt() is a fast version of the Unix crypt(3) function.  This version takes only a small amount of space relative to other fast crypt() implementations.  This is different to the normal crypt() in that the third parameter is the buffer that the return value is written into.  It needs to be at least 14 bytes long.  This function is thread safe, unlike the normal crypt().</p> <p>DES_crypt() is a faster replacement for the normal system crypt(). This function calls DES_fcrypt() with a static array passed as the third parameter.  This mostly emulates the normal non-thread-safe semantics of crypt(3). The salt must be two ASCII characters.</p> <p>The values returned by DES_fcrypt() and DES_crypt() are terminated by NUL character.</p> <p>DES_enc_write() writes len bytes to file descriptor fd from buffer buf. The data is encrypted via pcbc_encrypt (default) using sched for the key and iv as a starting vector.  The actual data send down fd consists of 4 bytes (in network byte order) containing the length of the following encrypted data.  The encrypted data then follows, padded with random data out to a multiple of 8 bytes.</p>"},{"location":"man3/DES_random_key/#bugs","title":"BUGS","text":"<p>DES_cbc_encrypt() does not modify ivec; use DES_ncbc_encrypt() instead.</p> <p>DES_cfb_encrypt() and DES_ofb_encrypt() operates on input of 8 bits. What this means is that if you set numbits to 12, and length to 2, the first 12 bits will come from the 1st input byte and the low half of the second input byte.  The second 12 bits will have the low 8 bits taken from the 3rd input byte and the top 4 bits taken from the 4th input byte.  The same holds for output.

DTLSv1_listen() statelessly listens for new incoming DTLS connections. If a ClientHello is received that does not contain a cookie, then they respond with a request for a new ClientHello that does contain a cookie. If a ClientHello is received with a cookie that is verified then the function returns in order to enable the handshake to be completed (for example by using SSL_accept()).</p>"},{"location":"man3/DTLSv1_listen/#notes","title":"NOTES","text":"<p>Some transport protocols (such as UDP) can be susceptible to amplification attacks. Unlike TCP there is no initial connection setup in UDP that validates that the client can actually receive messages on its advertised source address. An attacker could forge its source IP address and then send handshake initiation messages to the server. The server would then send its response to the forged source IP. If the response messages are larger than the original message then the amplification attack has succeeded.</p> <p>If DTLS is used over UDP (or any datagram based protocol that does not validate the source IP) then it is susceptible to this type of attack. TLSv1.3 is designed to operate over a stream-based transport protocol (such as TCP). If TCP is being used then there is no need to use SSL_stateless(). However, some stream-based transport protocols (e.g. QUIC) may not validate the source address. In this case a TLSv1.3 application would be susceptible to this attack.</p> <p>As a countermeasure to this issue TLSv1.3 and DTLS include a stateless cookie mechanism. The idea is that when a client attempts to connect to a server it sends a ClientHello message. The server responds with a HelloRetryRequest (in TLSv1.3) or a HelloVerifyRequest (in DTLS) which contains a unique cookie. The client then resends the ClientHello, but this time includes the cookie in the message thus proving that the client is capable of receiving messages sent to that address. All of this can be done by the server without allocating any state, and thus without consuming expensive resources.</p> <p>OpenSSL implements this capability via the SSL_stateless() and DTLSv1_listen() functions. The ssl parameter should be a newly allocated SSL object with its read and write BIOs set, in the same way as might be done for a call to SSL_accept(). Typically, for DTLS, the read BIO will be in an \"unconnected\" state and thus capable of receiving messages from any peer.</p> <p>When a ClientHello is received that contains a cookie that has been verified, then these functions will return with the ssl parameter updated into a state where the handshake can be continued by a call to (for example) SSL_accept(). Additionally, for DTLSv1_listen(), the BIO_ADDR pointed to by peer will be filled in with details of the peer that sent the ClientHello. If the underlying BIO is unable to obtain the BIO_ADDR of the peer (for example because the BIO does not support this), then *peer will be cleared and the family set to AF_UNSPEC. Typically user code is expected to \"connect\" the underlying socket to the peer and continue the handshake in a connected state.</p> <p>Prior to calling DTLSv1_listen() user code must ensure that cookie generation and verification callbacks have been set up using SSL_CTX_set_cookie_generate_cb(3) and SSL_CTX_set_cookie_verify_cb(3) respectively. For SSL_stateless(), SSL_CTX_set_stateless_cookie_generate_cb(3) and SSL_CTX_set_stateless_cookie_verify_cb(3) must be used instead.</p> <p>Since DTLSv1_listen() operates entirely statelessly whilst processing incoming ClientHellos it is unable to process fragmented messages (since this would require the allocation of state). An implication of this is that DTLSv1_listen() only supports ClientHellos that fit inside a single datagram.</p> <p>For SSL_stateless() if an entire ClientHello message cannot be read without the \"read\" BIO becoming empty then the SSL_stateless() call will fail. It is the application's responsibility to ensure that data read from the \"read\" BIO during a single SSL_stateless() call is all from the same peer.</p> <p>SSL_stateless() will fail (with a 0 return value) if some TLS version less than TLSv1.3 is used.</p> <p>Both SSL_stateless() and DTLSv1_listen() will clear the error queue when they start.</p>"},{"location":"man3/DTLSv1_listen/#return-values","title":"RETURN VALUES","text":"<p>For SSL_stateless() a return value of 1 indicates success and the ssl object will be set up ready to continue the handshake.

If asn1_flag is OPENSSL_EC_NAMED_CURVE then the named curve form is used and the parameters must have a corresponding named curve NID set. If asn1_flags is OPENSSL_EC_EXPLICIT_CURVE the parameters are explicitly encoded. The functions EC_GROUP_get_asn1_flag() and EC_GROUP_set_asn1_flag() get and set the status of the asn1_flag for the curve. Note: OPENSSL_EC_EXPLICIT_CURVE was added in OpenSSL 1.1.0, for previous versions of OpenSSL the value 0 must be used instead. Before OpenSSL 1.1.0 the default form was to use explicit parameters (meaning that applications would have to explicitly set the named curve form) in OpenSSL 1.1.0 and later the named curve form is the default.</p> <p>The point_conversion_form for a curve controls how EC_POINT data is encoded as ASN1 as defined in X9.62 (ECDSA). point_conversion_form_t is an enum defined as follows:</p> <pre><code>typedef enum {\n       /** the point is encoded as z||x, where the octet z specifies\n        *   which solution of the quadratic equation y is  */\n       POINT_CONVERSION_COMPRESSED = 2,\n       /** the point is encoded as z||x||y, where z is the octet 0x04  */\n       POINT_CONVERSION_UNCOMPRESSED = 4,\n       /** the point is encoded as z||x||y, where the octet z specifies\n        *  which solution of the quadratic equation y is  */\n       POINT_CONVERSION_HYBRID = 6\n} point_conversion_form_t;\n</code></pre> <p>For POINT_CONVERSION_UNCOMPRESSED the point is encoded as an octet signifying the UNCOMPRESSED form has been used followed by the octets for x, followed by the octets for y.</p> <p>For any given x co-ordinate for a point on a curve it is possible to derive two possible y values. For POINT_CONVERSION_COMPRESSED the point is encoded as an octet signifying that the COMPRESSED form has been used AND which of the two possible solutions for y has been used, followed by the octets for x.</p> <p>For POINT_CONVERSION_HYBRID the point is encoded as an octet signifying the HYBRID form has been used AND which of the two possible solutions for y has been used, followed by the octets for x, followed by the octets for y.</p> <p>The functions EC_GROUP_set_point_conversion_form() and EC_GROUP_get_point_conversion_form(), set and get the point_conversion_form for the curve respectively.</p> <p>ANSI X9.62 (ECDSA standard) defines a method of generating the curve parameter b from a random number. This provides advantages in that a parameter obtained in this way is highly unlikely to be susceptible to special purpose attacks, or have any trapdoors in it. If the seed is present for a curve then the b parameter was generated in a verifiable fashion using that seed. The OpenSSL EC library does not use this seed value but does enable you to inspect it using EC_GROUP_get0_seed(). This returns a pointer to a memory block containing the seed that was used. The length of the memory block can be obtained using EC_GROUP_get_seed_len(). A number of the built-in curves within the library provide seed values that can be obtained. It is also possible to set a custom seed using EC_GROUP_set_seed() and passing a pointer to a memory block, along with the length of the seed. Again, the EC library will not use this seed value, although it will be preserved in any ASN1 based communications.</p> <p>EC_GROUP_get_degree() gets the degree of the field. For Fp fields this will be the number of bits in p.  For F2^m fields this will be the value m.</p> <p>The function EC_GROUP_check_discriminant() calculates the discriminant for the curve and verifies that it is valid. For a curve defined over Fp the discriminant is given by the formula 4*a^3 + 27*b^2 whilst for F2^m curves the discriminant is simply b. In either case for the curve to be valid the discriminant must be non zero.</p> <p>The function EC_GROUP_check() performs a number of checks on a curve to verify that it is valid. Checks performed include verifying that the discriminant is non zero; that a generator has been defined; that the generator is on the curve and has the correct order.</p> <p>EC_GROUP_cmp() compares a and b to determine whether they represent the same curve or not.</p> <p>The functions EC_GROUP_get_basis_type(), EC_GROUP_get_trinomial_basis() and EC_GROUP_get_pentanomial_basis() should only be called for curves defined over an F2^m field. Addition and multiplication operations within an F2^m field are performed using an irreducible polynomial function f(x). This function is either a trinomial of the form:</p> <p>f(x) = x^m + x^k + 1 with m &gt; k &gt;= 1</p> <p>or a pentanomial of the form:</p> <p>f(x) = x^m + x^k3 + x^k2 + x^k1 + 1 with m &gt; k3 &gt; k2 &gt; k1 &gt;= 1</p> <p>The function EC_GROUP_get_basis_type() returns a NID identifying whether a trinomial or pentanomial is in use for the field. The function EC_GROUP_get_trinomial_basis() must only be called where f(x) is of the trinomial form, and returns the value of k. Similarly the function EC_GROUP_get_pentanomial_basis() must only be called where f(x) is of the pentanomial form, and returns the values of k1, k2 and k3 respectively.</p>"},{"location":"man3/EC_GROUP_copy/#return-values","title":"RETURN VALUES","text":"<p>The following functions return 1 on success or 0 on error: EC_GROUP_copy(), EC_GROUP_set_generator(), EC_GROUP_check(), EC_GROUP_check_discriminant(), EC_GROUP_get_trinomial_basis() and EC_GROUP_get_pentanomial_basis().</p> <p>EC_GROUP_dup() returns a pointer to the duplicated curve, or NULL on error.</p> <p>EC_GROUP_method_of() returns the EC_METHOD implementation in use for the given curve or NULL on error.</p> <p>EC_GROUP_get0_generator() returns the generator for the given curve or NULL on error.</p> <p>EC_GROUP_get_order() returns 0 if the order is not set (or set to zero) for group or if copying into order fails, 1 otherwise.</p> <p>EC_GROUP_get_cofactor() returns 0 if the cofactor is not set (or is set to zero) for group or if copying into cofactor fails, 1 otherwise.</p> <p>EC_GROUP_get_curve_name() returns the curve name (NID) for group or will return NID_undef if no curve name is associated.</p> <p>EC_GROUP_get_asn1_flag() returns the ASN1 flag for the specified group .</p> <p>EC_GROUP_get_point_conversion_form() returns the point_conversion_form for group.</p> <p>EC_GROUP_get_degree() returns the degree for group or 0 if the operation is not supported by the underlying group implementation.</p> <p>EC_GROUP_get0_order() returns an internal pointer to the group order.

For this form the elliptic curve equation is modified to:</p> <p>y^2 + xy = x^3 + ax^2 + b (where b != 0)</p> <p>Operations in a binary field are performed relative to an irreducible polynomial. All such curves with OpenSSL use a trinomial or a pentanomial for this parameter.</p> <p>A new curve can be constructed by calling EC_GROUP_new(), using the implementation provided by meth (see EC_GFp_simple_method(3)). It is then necessary to call EC_GROUP_set_curve() to set the curve parameters.

A new EC_KEY with no associated curve can be constructed by calling EC_KEY_new(). The reference count for the newly created EC_KEY is initially set to 1. A curve can be associated with the EC_KEY by calling EC_KEY_set_group().</p> <p>Alternatively a new EC_KEY can be constructed by calling EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name() and supplying the nid of the associated curve. See EC_GROUP_new(3) for a description of curve names. This function simply wraps calls to EC_KEY_new() and EC_GROUP_new_by_curve_name().</p> <p>Calling EC_KEY_free() decrements the reference count for the EC_KEY object, and if it has dropped to zero then frees the memory associated with it.  If key is NULL nothing is done.</p> <p>EC_KEY_copy() copies the contents of the EC_KEY in src into dest.</p> <p>EC_KEY_dup() creates a new EC_KEY object and copies ec_key into it.</p> <p>EC_KEY_up_ref() increments the reference count associated with the EC_KEY object.</p> <p>EC_KEY_get0_engine() returns a handle to the ENGINE that has been set for this EC_KEY object.</p> <p>EC_KEY_generate_key() generates a new public and private key for the supplied eckey object. eckey must have an EC_GROUP object associated with it before calling this function. The private key is a random integer (0 &lt; priv_key &lt; order, where order is the order of the EC_GROUP object). The public key is an EC_POINT on the curve calculated by multiplying the generator for the curve by the private key.</p> <p>EC_KEY_check_key() performs various sanity checks on the EC_KEY object to confirm that it is valid.</p> <p>EC_KEY_set_public_key_affine_coordinates() sets the public key for key based on its affine co-ordinates; i.e., it constructs an EC_POINT object based on the supplied x and y values and sets the public key to be this EC_POINT. It also performs certain sanity checks on the key to confirm that it is valid.</p> <p>The functions EC_KEY_get0_group(), EC_KEY_set_group(), EC_KEY_get0_private_key(), EC_KEY_set_private_key(), EC_KEY_get0_public_key(), and EC_KEY_set_public_key() get and set the EC_GROUP object, the private key, and the EC_POINT public key for the key respectively. The function EC_KEY_set_private_key() accepts NULL as the priv_key argument to securely clear the private key component from the EC_KEY.</p> <p>The functions EC_KEY_get_conv_form() and EC_KEY_set_conv_form() get and set the point_conversion_form for the key. For a description of point_conversion_forms please see EC_POINT_new(3).</p> <p>EC_KEY_set_flags() sets the flags in the flags parameter on the EC_KEY object. Any flags that are already set are left set. The flags currently defined are EC_FLAG_NON_FIPS_ALLOW and EC_FLAG_FIPS_CHECKED. In addition there is the flag EC_FLAG_COFACTOR_ECDH which is specific to ECDH. EC_KEY_get_flags() returns the current flags that are set for this EC_KEY. EC_KEY_clear_flags() clears the flags indicated by the flags parameter; all other flags are left in their existing state.</p> <p>EC_KEY_set_asn1_flag() sets the asn1_flag on the underlying EC_GROUP object (if set). Refer to EC_GROUP_copy(3) for further information on the asn1_flag.</p> <p>EC_KEY_decoded_from_explicit_params() returns 1 if the group of the key was decoded from data with explicitly encoded group parameters, -1 if the key is NULL or the group parameters are missing, and 0 otherwise.</p> <p>EC_KEY_precompute_mult() stores multiples of the underlying EC_GROUP generator for faster point multiplication.

The octet form consists of the content octets of the privateKey OCTET STRING in an ECPrivateKey ASN.1 structure.</p> <p>The function EC_KEY_priv2oct() must be supplied with a buffer long enough to store the octet form. The return value provides the number of octets stored. Calling the function with a NULL buffer will not perform the conversion but will just return the required buffer length.</p> <p>The function EC_KEY_priv2buf() allocates a buffer of suitable length and writes an EC_KEY to it in octet format. The allocated buffer is written to *pbuf and its length is returned. The caller must free up the allocated buffer with a call to OPENSSL_free().

The function EC_POINT_get_affine_coordinates() sets x and y, either of which may be NULL, to the corresponding coordinates of p.</p> <p>The functions EC_POINT_set_affine_coordinates_GFp() and EC_POINT_set_affine_coordinates_GF2m() are synonyms for EC_POINT_set_affine_coordinates().

They are defined for backwards compatibility only and should not be used.</p> <p>As well as the affine co-ordinates, a point can alternatively be described in terms of its Jacobian projective co-ordinates (for Fp curves only). Jacobian projective co-ordinates are expressed as three values x, y and z. Working in this co-ordinate system provides more efficient point multiplication operations.  A mapping exists between Jacobian projective co-ordinates and affine co-ordinates. A Jacobian projective co-ordinate (x, y, z) can be written as an affine co-ordinate as (x/(z^2), y/(z^3)). Conversion to Jacobian projective from affine co-ordinates is simple. The co-ordinate (x, y) is mapped to (x, y, 1). To set or get the projective co-ordinates use EC_POINT_set_Jprojective_coordinates_GFp() and EC_POINT_get_Jprojective_coordinates_GFp() respectively.</p> <p>Points can also be described in terms of their compressed co-ordinates. For a point (x, y), for any given value for x such that the point is on the curve there will only ever be two possible values for y. Therefore, a point can be set using the EC_POINT_set_compressed_coordinates() function where x is the x co-ordinate and y_bit is a value 0 or 1 to identify which of the two possible values for y should be used.</p> <p>The functions EC_POINT_set_compressed_coordinates_GFp() and EC_POINT_set_compressed_coordinates_GF2m() are synonyms for EC_POINT_set_compressed_coordinates(). They are defined for backwards compatibility only and should not be used.</p> <p>In addition EC_POINT can be converted to and from various external representations. The octet form is the binary encoding of the ECPoint structure (as defined in RFC5480 and used in certificates and TLS records): only the content octets are present, the OCTET STRING tag and length are not included. BIGNUM form is the octet form interpreted as a big endian integer converted to a BIGNUM structure. Hexadecimal form is the octet form converted to a NULL terminated character string where each character is one of the printable values 0-9 or A-F (or a-f).</p> <p>The functions EC_POINT_point2oct(), EC_POINT_oct2point(), EC_POINT_point2bn(), EC_POINT_bn2point(), EC_POINT_point2hex() and EC_POINT_hex2point() convert from and to EC_POINTs for the formats: octet, BIGNUM and hexadecimal respectively.</p> <p>The function EC_POINT_point2oct() encodes the given curve point p as an octet string into the buffer buf of size len, using the specified conversion form form. The encoding conforms with Sec. 2.3.3 of the SECG SEC 1 (\"Elliptic Curve Cryptography\") standard. Similarly the function EC_POINT_oct2point() decodes a curve point into p from the octet string contained in the given buffer buf of size len, conforming to Sec. 2.3.4 of the SECG SEC 1 (\"Elliptic Curve Cryptography\") standard.</p> <p>The functions EC_POINT_point2hex() and EC_POINT_point2bn() convert a point p, respectively, to the hexadecimal or BIGNUM representation of the same encoding of the function EC_POINT_point2oct(). Vice versa, similarly to the function EC_POINT_oct2point(), the functions EC_POINT_hex2point() and EC_POINT_point2bn() decode the hexadecimal or BIGNUM representation into the EC_POINT p.</p> <p>Notice that, according to the standard, the octet string encoding of the point at infinity for a given curve is fixed to a single octet of value zero and that, vice versa, a single octet of size zero is decoded as the point at infinity.</p> <p>The function EC_POINT_point2oct() must be supplied with a buffer long enough to store the octet form. The return value provides the number of octets stored. Calling the function with a NULL buffer will not perform the conversion but will still return the required buffer length.</p> <p>The function EC_POINT_point2buf() allocates a buffer of suitable length and writes an EC_POINT to it in octet format. The allocated buffer is written to *pbuf and its length is returned. The caller must free up the allocated buffer with a call to OPENSSL_free(). Since the allocated buffer value is written to *pbuf the pbuf parameter MUST NOT be NULL.</p> <p>The function EC_POINT_point2hex() will allocate sufficient memory to store the hexadecimal string.

Ie. one should obtain a new reference when making copies of an ENGINE pointer if the copies will be used (and released) independently.</p> <p>ENGINE objects have two levels of reference-counting to match the way in which the objects are used. At the most basic level, each ENGINE pointer is inherently a structural reference - a structural reference is required to use the pointer value at all, as this kind of reference is a guarantee that the structure can not be deallocated until the reference is released.</p> <p>However, a structural reference provides no guarantee that the ENGINE is initialised and able to use any of its cryptographic implementations. Indeed it's quite possible that most ENGINEs will not initialise at all in typical environments, as ENGINEs are typically used to support specialised hardware. To use an ENGINE's functionality, you need a functional reference. This kind of reference can be considered a specialised form of structural reference, because each functional reference implicitly contains a structural reference as well - however to avoid difficult-to-find programming bugs, it is recommended to treat the two kinds of reference independently. If you have a functional reference to an ENGINE, you have a guarantee that the ENGINE has been initialised and is ready to perform cryptographic operations, and will remain initialised until after you have released your reference.</p> <p>Structural references</p> <p>This basic type of reference is used for instantiating new ENGINEs, iterating across OpenSSL's internal linked-list of loaded ENGINEs, reading information about an ENGINE, etc. Essentially a structural reference is sufficient if you only need to query or manipulate the data of an ENGINE implementation rather than use its functionality.</p> <p>The ENGINE_new() function returns a structural reference to a new (empty) ENGINE object. There are other ENGINE API functions that return structural references such as; ENGINE_by_id(), ENGINE_get_first(), ENGINE_get_last(), ENGINE_get_next(), ENGINE_get_prev(). All structural references should be released by a corresponding to call to the ENGINE_free() function - the ENGINE object itself will only actually be cleaned up and deallocated when the last structural reference is released.</p> <p>It should also be noted that many ENGINE API function calls that accept a structural reference will internally obtain another reference - typically this happens whenever the supplied ENGINE will be needed by OpenSSL after the function has returned. Eg. the function to add a new ENGINE to OpenSSL's internal list is ENGINE_add() - if this function returns success, then OpenSSL will have stored a new structural reference internally so the caller is still responsible for freeing their own reference with ENGINE_free() when they are finished with it. In a similar way, some functions will automatically release the structural reference passed to it if part of the function's job is to do so. Eg. the ENGINE_get_next() and ENGINE_get_prev() functions are used for iterating across the internal ENGINE list - they will return a new structural reference to the next (or previous) ENGINE in the list or NULL if at the end (or beginning) of the list, but in either case the structural reference passed to the function is released on behalf of the caller.</p> <p>To clarify a particular function's handling of references, one should always consult that function's documentation \"man\" page, or failing that the openssl/engine.h header file includes some hints.</p> <p>Functional references</p> <p>As mentioned, functional references exist when the cryptographic functionality of an ENGINE is required to be available. A functional reference can be obtained in one of two ways; from an existing structural reference to the required ENGINE, or by asking OpenSSL for the default operational ENGINE for a given cryptographic purpose.</p> <p>To obtain a functional reference from an existing structural reference, call the ENGINE_init() function. This returns zero if the ENGINE was not already operational and couldn't be successfully initialised (e.g. lack of system drivers, no special hardware attached, etc), otherwise it will return nonzero to indicate that the ENGINE is now operational and will have allocated a new functional reference to the ENGINE. All functional references are released by calling ENGINE_finish() (which removes the implicit structural reference as well).</p> <p>The second way to get a functional reference is by asking OpenSSL for a default implementation for a given task, e.g. by ENGINE_get_default_RSA(), ENGINE_get_default_cipher_engine(), etc. These are discussed in the next section, though they are not usually required by application programmers as they are used automatically when creating and using the relevant algorithm-specific types in OpenSSL, such as RSA, DSA, EVP_CIPHER_CTX, etc.</p>"},{"location":"man3/ENGINE_add/#default-implementations","title":"Default implementations","text":"<p>For each supported abstraction, the ENGINE code maintains an internal table of state to control which implementations are available for a given abstraction and which should be used by default. These implementations are registered in the tables and indexed by an 'nid' value, because abstractions like EVP_CIPHER and EVP_DIGEST support many distinct algorithms and modes, and ENGINEs can support arbitrarily many of them. In the case of other abstractions like RSA, DSA, etc, there is only one \"algorithm\" so all implementations implicitly register using the same 'nid' index.</p> <p>When a default ENGINE is requested for a given abstraction/algorithm/mode, (e.g. when calling RSA_new_method(NULL)), a \"get_default\" call will be made to the ENGINE subsystem to process the corresponding state table and return a functional reference to an initialised ENGINE whose implementation should be used. If no ENGINE should (or can) be used, it will return NULL and the caller will operate with a NULL ENGINE handle - this usually equates to using the conventional software implementation. In the latter case, OpenSSL will from then on behave the way it used to before the ENGINE API existed.</p> <p>Each state table has a flag to note whether it has processed this \"get_default\" query since the table was last modified, because to process this question it must iterate across all the registered ENGINEs in the table trying to initialise each of them in turn, in case one of them is operational. If it returns a functional reference to an ENGINE, it will also cache another reference to speed up processing future queries (without needing to iterate across the table). Likewise, it will cache a NULL response if no ENGINE was available so that future queries won't repeat the same iteration unless the state table changes. This behaviour can also be changed; if the ENGINE_TABLE_FLAG_NOINIT flag is set (using ENGINE_set_table_flags()), no attempted initialisations will take place, instead the only way for the state table to return a non-NULL ENGINE to the \"get_default\" query will be if one is expressly set in the table. Eg. ENGINE_set_default_RSA() does the same job as ENGINE_register_RSA() except that it also sets the state table's cached response for the \"get_default\" query. In the case of abstractions like EVP_CIPHER, where implementations are indexed by 'nid', these flags and cached-responses are distinct for each 'nid' value.</p>"},{"location":"man3/ENGINE_add/#application-requirements","title":"Application requirements","text":"<p>This section will explain the basic things an application programmer should support to make the most useful elements of the ENGINE functionality available to the user. The first thing to consider is whether the programmer wishes to make alternative ENGINE modules available to the application and user. OpenSSL maintains an internal linked list of \"visible\" ENGINEs from which it has to operate - at start-up, this list is empty and in fact if an application does not call any ENGINE API calls and it uses static linking against openssl, then the resulting application binary will not contain any alternative ENGINE code at all. So the first consideration is whether any/all available ENGINE implementations should be made visible to OpenSSL - this is controlled by calling the various \"load\" functions.</p> <p>The fact that ENGINEs are made visible to OpenSSL (and thus are linked into the program and loaded into memory at run-time) does not mean they are \"registered\" or called into use by OpenSSL automatically - that behaviour is something for the application to control. Some applications will want to allow the user to specify exactly which ENGINE they want used if any is to be used at all. Others may prefer to load all support and have OpenSSL automatically use at run-time any ENGINE that is able to successfully initialise - i.e. to assume that this corresponds to acceleration hardware attached to the machine or some such thing. There are probably numerous other ways in which applications may prefer to handle things, so we will simply illustrate the consequences as they apply to a couple of simple cases and leave developers to consider these and the source code to openssl's builtin utilities as guides.</p> <p>If no ENGINE API functions are called within an application, then OpenSSL will not allocate any internal resources.  Prior to OpenSSL 1.1.0, however, if any ENGINEs are loaded, even if not registered or used, it was necessary to call ENGINE_cleanup() before the program exits.</p> <p>Using a specific ENGINE implementation</p> <p>Here we'll assume an application has been configured by its user or admin to want to use the \"ACME\" ENGINE if it is available in the version of OpenSSL the application was compiled with. If it is available, it should be used by default for all RSA, DSA, and symmetric cipher operations, otherwise OpenSSL should use its builtin software as per usual. The following code illustrates how to approach this;</p> <pre><code>ENGINE *e;\nconst char *engine_id = \"ACME\";\nENGINE_load_builtin_engines();\ne = ENGINE_by_id(engine_id);\nif (!e)\n    /* the engine isn't available */\n    return;\nif (!ENGINE_init(e)) {\n    /* the engine couldn't initialise, release 'e' */\n    ENGINE_free(e);\n    return;\n}\nif (!ENGINE_set_default_RSA(e))\n    /*\n     * This should only happen when 'e' can't initialise, but the previous\n     * statement suggests it did.\n     */\n    abort();\nENGINE_set_default_DSA(e);\nENGINE_set_default_ciphers(e);\n/* Release the functional reference from ENGINE_init() */\nENGINE_finish(e);\n/* Release the structural reference from ENGINE_by_id() */\nENGINE_free(e);\n</code></pre> <p>Automatically using builtin ENGINE implementations</p> <p>Here we'll assume we want to load and register all ENGINE implementations bundled with OpenSSL, such that for any cryptographic algorithm required by OpenSSL - if there is an ENGINE that implements it and can be initialised, it should be used. The following code illustrates how this can work;</p> <pre><code>/* Load all bundled ENGINEs into memory and make them visible */\nENGINE_load_builtin_engines();\n/* Register all of them for every algorithm they collectively implement */\nENGINE_register_all_complete();\n</code></pre> <p>That's all that's required. Eg. the next time OpenSSL tries to set up an RSA key, any bundled ENGINEs that implement RSA_METHOD will be passed to ENGINE_init() and if any of those succeed, that ENGINE will be set as the default for RSA use from then on.</p>"},{"location":"man3/ENGINE_add/#advanced-configuration-support","title":"Advanced configuration support","text":"<p>There is a mechanism supported by the ENGINE framework that allows each ENGINE implementation to define an arbitrary set of configuration \"commands\" and expose them to OpenSSL and any applications based on OpenSSL. This mechanism is entirely based on the use of name-value pairs and assumes ASCII input (no unicode or UTF for now!), so it is ideal if applications want to provide a transparent way for users to provide arbitrary configuration \"directives\" directly to such ENGINEs. It is also possible for the application to dynamically interrogate the loaded ENGINE implementations for the names, descriptions, and input flags of their available \"control commands\", providing a more flexible configuration scheme. However, if the user is expected to know which ENGINE device he/she is using (in the case of specialised hardware, this goes without saying) then applications may not need to concern themselves with discovering the supported control commands and simply prefer to pass settings into ENGINEs exactly as they are provided by the user.</p> <p>Before illustrating how control commands work, it is worth mentioning what they are typically used for. Broadly speaking there are two uses for control commands; the first is to provide the necessary details to the implementation (which may know nothing at all specific to the host system) so that it can be initialised for use. This could include the path to any driver or config files it needs to load, required network addresses, smart-card identifiers, passwords to initialise protected devices, logging information, etc etc. This class of commands typically needs to be passed to an ENGINE before attempting to initialise it, i.e. before calling ENGINE_init(). The other class of commands consist of settings or operations that tweak certain behaviour or cause certain operations to take place, and these commands may work either before or after ENGINE_init(), or in some cases both. ENGINE implementations should provide indications of this in the descriptions attached to builtin control commands and/or in external product documentation.</p> <p>Issuing control commands to an ENGINE</p> <p>Let's illustrate by example; a function for which the caller supplies the name of the ENGINE it wishes to use, a table of string-pairs for use before initialisation, and another table for use after initialisation. Note that the string-pairs used for control commands consist of a command \"name\" followed by the command \"parameter\" - the parameter could be NULL in some cases but the name can not. This function should initialise the ENGINE (issuing the \"pre\" commands beforehand and the \"post\" commands afterwards) and set it as the default for everything except RAND and then return a boolean success or failure.</p> <pre><code>int generic_load_engine_fn(const char *engine_id,\n                           const char **pre_cmds, int pre_num,\n                           const char **post_cmds, int post_num)\n{\n    ENGINE *e = ENGINE_by_id(engine_id);\n    if (!e) return 0;\n    while (pre_num--) {\n        if (!ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, pre_cmds[0], pre_cmds[1], 0)) {\n            fprintf(stderr, \"Failed command (%s - %s:%s)\\n\", engine_id,\n                    pre_cmds[0], pre_cmds[1] ? pre_cmds[1] : \"(NULL)\");\n            ENGINE_free(e);\n            return 0;\n        }\n        pre_cmds += 2;\n    }\n    if (!ENGINE_init(e)) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Failed initialisation\\n\");\n        ENGINE_free(e);\n        return 0;\n    }\n    /*\n     * ENGINE_init() returned a functional reference, so free the structural\n     * reference from ENGINE_by_id().\n     */\n    ENGINE_free(e);\n    while (post_num--) {\n        if (!ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, post_cmds[0], post_cmds[1], 0)) {\n            fprintf(stderr, \"Failed command (%s - %s:%s)\\n\", engine_id,\n                    post_cmds[0], post_cmds[1] ? post_cmds[1] : \"(NULL)\");\n            ENGINE_finish(e);\n            return 0;\n        }\n        post_cmds += 2;\n    }\n    ENGINE_set_default(e, ENGINE_METHOD_ALL &amp; ~ENGINE_METHOD_RAND);\n    /* Success */\n    return 1;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string() accepts a boolean argument that can relax the semantics of the function - if set nonzero it will only return failure if the ENGINE supported the given command name but failed while executing it, if the ENGINE doesn't support the command name it will simply return success without doing anything. In this case we assume the user is only supplying commands specific to the given ENGINE so we set this to FALSE.</p> <p>Discovering supported control commands</p> <p>It is possible to discover at run-time the names, numerical-ids, descriptions and input parameters of the control commands supported by an ENGINE using a structural reference. Note that some control commands are defined by OpenSSL itself and it will intercept and handle these control commands on behalf of the ENGINE, i.e. the ENGINE's ctrl() handler is not used for the control command. openssl/engine.h defines an index, ENGINE_CMD_BASE, that all control commands implemented by ENGINEs should be numbered from. Any command value lower than this symbol is considered a \"generic\" command is handled directly by the OpenSSL core routines.</p> <p>It is using these \"core\" control commands that one can discover the control commands implemented by a given ENGINE, specifically the commands:</p> <pre><code>ENGINE_HAS_CTRL_FUNCTION\nENGINE_CTRL_GET_FIRST_CMD_TYPE\nENGINE_CTRL_GET_NEXT_CMD_TYPE\nENGINE_CTRL_GET_CMD_FROM_NAME\nENGINE_CTRL_GET_NAME_LEN_FROM_CMD\nENGINE_CTRL_GET_NAME_FROM_CMD\nENGINE_CTRL_GET_DESC_LEN_FROM_CMD\nENGINE_CTRL_GET_DESC_FROM_CMD\nENGINE_CTRL_GET_CMD_FLAGS\n</code></pre> <p>Whilst these commands are automatically processed by the OpenSSL framework code, they use various properties exposed by each ENGINE to process these queries. An ENGINE has 3 properties it exposes that can affect how this behaves; it can supply a ctrl() handler, it can specify ENGINE_FLAGS_MANUAL_CMD_CTRL in the ENGINE's flags, and it can expose an array of control command descriptions. If an ENGINE specifies the ENGINE_FLAGS_MANUAL_CMD_CTRL flag, then it will simply pass all these \"core\" control commands directly to the ENGINE's ctrl() handler (and thus, it must have supplied one), so it is up to the ENGINE to reply to these \"discovery\" commands itself. If that flag is not set, then the OpenSSL framework code will work with the following rules:</p> <pre><code>if no ctrl() handler supplied;\n    ENGINE_HAS_CTRL_FUNCTION returns FALSE (zero),\n    all other commands fail.\nif a ctrl() handler was supplied but no array of control commands;\n    ENGINE_HAS_CTRL_FUNCTION returns TRUE,\n    all other commands fail.\nif a ctrl() handler and array of control commands was supplied;\n    ENGINE_HAS_CTRL_FUNCTION returns TRUE,\n    all other commands proceed processing ...\n</code></pre> <p>If the ENGINE's array of control commands is empty then all other commands will fail, otherwise; ENGINE_CTRL_GET_FIRST_CMD_TYPE returns the identifier of the first command supported by the ENGINE, ENGINE_GET_NEXT_CMD_TYPE takes the identifier of a command supported by the ENGINE and returns the next command identifier or fails if there are no more, ENGINE_CMD_FROM_NAME takes a string name for a command and returns the corresponding identifier or fails if no such command name exists, and the remaining commands take a command identifier and return properties of the corresponding commands. All except ENGINE_CTRL_GET_FLAGS return the string length of a command name or description, or populate a supplied character buffer with a copy of the command name or description. ENGINE_CTRL_GET_FLAGS returns a bitwise-OR'd mask of the following possible values:</p> <pre><code>ENGINE_CMD_FLAG_NUMERIC\nENGINE_CMD_FLAG_STRING\nENGINE_CMD_FLAG_NO_INPUT\nENGINE_CMD_FLAG_INTERNAL\n</code></pre> <p>If the ENGINE_CMD_FLAG_INTERNAL flag is set, then any other flags are purely informational to the caller - this flag will prevent the command being usable for any higher-level ENGINE functions such as ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(). \"INTERNAL\" commands are not intended to be exposed to text-based configuration by applications, administrations, users, etc. These can support arbitrary operations via ENGINE_ctrl(), including passing to and/or from the control commands data of any arbitrary type. These commands are supported in the discovery mechanisms simply to allow applications to determine if an ENGINE supports certain specific commands it might want to use (e.g. application \"foo\" might query various ENGINEs to see if they implement \"FOO_GET_VENDOR_LOGO_GIF\" - and ENGINE could therefore decide whether or not to support this \"foo\"-specific extension).</p>"},{"location":"man3/ENGINE_add/#environment","title":"ENVIRONMENT","text":"<ul> <li> <p>OPENSSL_ENGINES</p> <p>The path to the engines directory.

Base 64 encoding converts binary data into a printable form that uses the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, \"+\" and \"/\" to represent the data. For every 3 bytes of binary data provided 4 bytes of base 64 encoded data will be produced plus some occasional newlines (see below). If the input data length is not a multiple of 3 then the output data will be padded at the end using the \"=\" character.</p> <p>EVP_ENCODE_CTX_new() allocates, initializes and returns a context to be used for the encode/decode functions.</p> <p>EVP_ENCODE_CTX_free() cleans up an encode/decode context ctx and frees up the space allocated to it.</p> <p>Encoding of binary data is performed in blocks of 48 input bytes (or less for the final block). For each 48 byte input block encoded 64 bytes of base 64 data is output plus an additional newline character (i.e. 65 bytes in total). The final block (which may be less than 48 bytes) will output 4 bytes for every 3 bytes of input. If the data length is not divisible by 3 then a full 4 bytes is still output for the final 1 or 2 bytes of input. Similarly a newline character will also be output.</p> <p>EVP_EncodeInit() initialises ctx for the start of a new encoding operation.</p> <p>EVP_EncodeUpdate() encode inl bytes of data found in the buffer pointed to by in. The output is stored in the buffer out and the number of bytes output is stored in *outl. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the buffer at out is sufficiently large to accommodate the output data. Only full blocks of data (48 bytes) will be immediately processed and output by this function. Any remainder is held in the ctx object and will be processed by a subsequent call to EVP_EncodeUpdate() or EVP_EncodeFinal(). To calculate the required size of the output buffer add together the value of inl with the amount of unprocessed data held in ctx and divide the result by 48 (ignore any remainder). This gives the number of blocks of data that will be processed. Ensure the output buffer contains 65 bytes of storage for each block, plus an additional byte for a NUL terminator. EVP_EncodeUpdate() may be called repeatedly to process large amounts of input data. In the event of an error EVP_EncodeUpdate() will set *outl to 0 and return 0. On success 1 will be returned.</p> <p>EVP_EncodeFinal() must be called at the end of an encoding operation. It will process any partial block of data remaining in the ctx object. The output data will be stored in out and the length of the data written will be stored in *outl. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that out is sufficiently large to accommodate the output data which will never be more than 65 bytes plus an additional NUL terminator (i.e. 66 bytes in total).</p> <p>EVP_ENCODE_CTX_copy() can be used to copy a context sctx to a context dctx. dctx must be initialized before calling this function.</p> <p>EVP_ENCODE_CTX_num() will return the number of as yet unprocessed bytes still to be encoded or decoded that are pending in the ctx object.</p> <p>EVP_EncodeBlock() encodes a full block of input data in f and of length n and stores it in t. For every 3 bytes of input provided 4 bytes of output data will be produced. If n is not divisible by 3 then the block is encoded as a final block of data and the output is padded such that it is always divisible by 4. Additionally a NUL terminator character will be added. For example if 16 bytes of input data is provided then 24 bytes of encoded data is created plus 1 byte for a NUL terminator (i.e. 25 bytes in total). The length of the data generated without the NUL terminator is returned from the function.</p> <p>EVP_DecodeInit() initialises ctx for the start of a new decoding operation.</p> <p>EVP_DecodeUpdate() decodes inl characters of data found in the buffer pointed to by in.

This function will attempt to decode as much data as possible in 4 byte chunks. Any whitespace, newline or carriage return characters are ignored. Any partial chunk of unprocessed data (1, 2 or 3 bytes) that remains at the end will be held in the ctx object and processed by a subsequent call to EVP_DecodeUpdate(). If any illegal base 64 characters are encountered or if the base 64 padding character \"=\" is encountered in the middle of the data then the function returns -1 to indicate an error. A return value of 0 or 1 indicates successful processing of the data. A return value of 0 additionally indicates that the last input data characters processed included the base 64 padding character \"=\" and therefore no more non-padding character data is expected to be processed.

If impl is NULL then the default implementation is used. key is the symmetric key to use and iv is the IV to use (if necessary), the actual number of bytes used for the key and IV depends on the cipher. It is possible to set all parameters to NULL except type in an initial call and supply the remaining parameters in subsequent calls, all of which have type set to NULL. This is done when the default cipher parameters are not appropriate.</p> <p>EVP_EncryptUpdate() encrypts inl bytes from the buffer in and writes the encrypted version to out. This function can be called multiple times to encrypt successive blocks of data. The amount of data written depends on the block alignment of the encrypted data. For most ciphers and modes, the amount of data written can be anything from zero bytes to (inl + cipher_block_size - 1) bytes. For wrap cipher modes, the amount of data written can be anything from zero bytes to (inl + cipher_block_size) bytes. For stream ciphers, the amount of data written can be anything from zero bytes to inl bytes. Thus, out should contain sufficient room for the operation being performed.

The actual NID value is an internal value which may not have a corresponding OBJECT IDENTIFIER.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding() enables or disables padding. This function should be called after the context is set up for encryption or decryption with EVP_EncryptInit_ex(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex() or EVP_CipherInit_ex(). By default encryption operations are padded using standard block padding and the padding is checked and removed when decrypting. If the pad parameter is zero then no padding is performed, the total amount of data encrypted or decrypted must then be a multiple of the block size or an error will occur.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_key_length() and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_key_length() return the key length of a cipher when passed an EVP_CIPHER or EVP_CIPHER_CTX structure. The constant EVP_MAX_KEY_LENGTH is the maximum key length for all ciphers. Note: although EVP_CIPHER_key_length() is fixed for a given cipher, the value of EVP_CIPHER_CTX_key_length() may be different for variable key length ciphers.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_key_length() sets the key length of the cipher ctx.

It will return zero if the cipher does not use an IV.  The constant EVP_MAX_IV_LENGTH is the maximum IV length for all ciphers.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_block_size() and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size() return the block size of a cipher when passed an EVP_CIPHER or EVP_CIPHER_CTX structure. The constant EVP_MAX_BLOCK_LENGTH is also the maximum block length for all ciphers.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_type() and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_type() return the type of the passed cipher or context. This \"type\" is the actual NID of the cipher OBJECT IDENTIFIER as such it ignores the cipher parameters and 40 bit RC2 and 128 bit RC2 have the same NID. If the cipher does not have an object identifier or does not have ASN1 support this function will return NID_undef.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_cipher() returns the EVP_CIPHER structure when passed an EVP_CIPHER_CTX structure.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_mode() and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_mode() return the block cipher mode: EVP_CIPH_ECB_MODE, EVP_CIPH_CBC_MODE, EVP_CIPH_CFB_MODE, EVP_CIPH_OFB_MODE, EVP_CIPH_CTR_MODE, EVP_CIPH_GCM_MODE, EVP_CIPH_CCM_MODE, EVP_CIPH_XTS_MODE, EVP_CIPH_WRAP_MODE or EVP_CIPH_OCB_MODE. If the cipher is a stream cipher then EVP_CIPH_STREAM_CIPHER is returned.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_param_to_asn1() sets the AlgorithmIdentifier \"parameter\" based on the passed cipher. This will typically include any parameters and an IV. The cipher IV (if any) must be set when this call is made. This call should be made before the cipher is actually \"used\" (before any EVP_EncryptUpdate(), EVP_DecryptUpdate() calls for example). This function may fail if the cipher does not have any ASN1 support.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_asn1_to_param() sets the cipher parameters based on an ASN1 AlgorithmIdentifier \"parameter\". The precise effect depends on the cipher In the case of RC2, for example, it will set the IV and effective key length. This function should be called after the base cipher type is set but before the key is set. For example EVP_CipherInit() will be called with the IV and key set to NULL, EVP_CIPHER_asn1_to_param() will be called and finally EVP_CipherInit() again with all parameters except the key set to NULL. It is possible for this function to fail if the cipher does not have any ASN1 support or the parameters cannot be set (for example the RC2 effective key length is not supported.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_ctrl() allows various cipher specific parameters to be determined and set.</p> <p>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_rand_key() generates a random key of the appropriate length based on the cipher context. The EVP_CIPHER can provide its own random key generation routine to support keys of a specific form.

This is because the code then becomes transparent to the cipher used and much more flexible. Additionally, the EVP interface will ensure the use of platform specific cryptographic acceleration such as AES-NI (the low-level interfaces do not provide the guarantee).</p> <p>PKCS padding works by adding n padding bytes of value n to make the total length of the encrypted data a multiple of the block size. Padding is always added so if the data is already a multiple of the block size n will equal the block size. For example if the block size is 8 and 11 bytes are to be encrypted then 5 padding bytes of value 5 will be added.</p> <p>When decrypting the final block is checked to see if it has the correct form.</p> <p>Although the decryption operation can produce an error if padding is enabled, it is not a strong test that the input data or key is correct. A random block has better than 1 in 256 chance of being of the correct format and problems with the input data earlier on will not produce a final decrypt error.</p> <p>If padding is disabled then the decryption operation will always succeed if the total amount of data decrypted is a multiple of the block size.</p> <p>The functions EVP_EncryptInit(), EVP_EncryptFinal(), EVP_DecryptInit(), EVP_CipherInit() and EVP_CipherFinal() are obsolete but are retained for compatibility with existing code.

In any case it returns the total string length, excluding the NUL character, required for non-truncated representation, or -1 on error. If no_name is 0 then if the object has a long or short name then that will be used, otherwise the numerical form will be used.

If the responder ID is a name then &lt;*pname&gt; is set to the name and *pid is set to NULL. If the responder ID is by key ID then *pid is set to the key ID and *pname is set to NULL.

Otherwise the function continues by validating the signer certificate.

After successful path validation the function returns success if the OCSP_NOCHECKS flag is set. Otherwise it verifies that the signer certificate meets the OCSP issuer criteria including potential delegation.

Allocated hash table entries will not be freed; consider using lh_TYPE_doall() to deallocate any remaining entries in the hash table (see below).</p> <p>lh_TYPE_insert() inserts the structure pointed to by data into table.  If there already is an entry with the same key, the old value is replaced. Note that lh_TYPE_insert() stores pointers, the data are not copied.</p> <p>lh_TYPE_delete() deletes an entry from table.</p> <p>lh_TYPE_retrieve() looks up an entry in table. Normally, data is a structure with the key field(s) set; the function will return a pointer to a fully populated structure.</p> <p>lh_TYPE_doall() will, for every entry in the hash table, call func with the data item as its parameter. For example:</p> <pre><code>/* Cleans up resources belonging to 'a' (this is implemented elsewhere) */\nvoid TYPE_cleanup_doall(TYPE *a);\n\n/* Implement a prototype-compatible wrapper for \"TYPE_cleanup\" */\nIMPLEMENT_LHASH_DOALL_FN(TYPE_cleanup, TYPE)\n\n/* Call \"TYPE_cleanup\" against all items in a hash table. */\nlh_TYPE_doall(hashtable, LHASH_DOALL_FN(TYPE_cleanup));\n\n/* Then the hash table itself can be deallocated */\nlh_TYPE_free(hashtable);\n</code></pre> <p>When doing this, be careful if you delete entries from the hash table in your callbacks: the table may decrease in size, moving the item that you are currently on down lower in the hash table - this could cause some entries to be skipped during the iteration.  The second best solution to this problem is to set hash-&gt;down_load=0 before you start (which will stop the hash table ever decreasing in size). The best solution is probably to avoid deleting items from the hash table inside a \"doall\" callback!</p> <p>lh_TYPE_doall_arg() is the same as lh_TYPE_doall() except that func will be called with arg as the second argument and func should be of type LHASH_DOALL_ARG_FN_TYPE (a callback prototype that is passed both the table entry and an extra argument).  As with lh_doall(), you can instead choose to declare your callback with a prototype matching the types you are dealing with and use the declare/implement macros to create compatible wrappers that cast variables before calling your type-specific callbacks.  An example of this is demonstrated here (printing all hash table entries to a BIO that is provided by the caller):</p> <pre><code>/* Prints item 'a' to 'output_bio' (this is implemented elsewhere) */\nvoid TYPE_print_doall_arg(const TYPE *a, BIO *output_bio);\n\n/* Implement a prototype-compatible wrapper for \"TYPE_print\" */\nstatic IMPLEMENT_LHASH_DOALL_ARG_FN(TYPE, const TYPE, BIO)\n\n/* Print out the entire hashtable to a particular BIO */\nlh_TYPE_doall_arg(hashtable, LHASH_DOALL_ARG_FN(TYPE_print), BIO,\n                  logging_bio);\n</code></pre> <p>lh_TYPE_error() can be used to determine if an error occurred in the last operation.</p>"},{"location":"man3/OPENSSL_LH_COMPFUNC/#return-values","title":"RETURN VALUES","text":"<p>lh_TYPE_new() returns NULL on error, otherwise a pointer to the new LHASH structure.</p> <p>When a hash table entry is replaced, lh_TYPE_insert() returns the value being replaced.

As such, it internally represents lh_insert()'d items with a \"const void *\" pointer type.  This is why callbacks such as those used by lh_doall() and lh_doall_arg() declare their prototypes with \"const\", even for the parameters that pass back the table items' data pointers - for consistency, user-provided data is \"const\" at all times as far as the LHASH code is concerned.  However, as callers are themselves providing these pointers, they can choose whether they too should be treating all such parameters as constant.</p> <p>As an example, a hash table may be maintained by code that, for reasons of encapsulation, has only \"const\" access to the data being indexed in the hash table (i.e. it is returned as \"const\" from elsewhere in their code) - in this case the LHASH prototypes are appropriate as-is.  Conversely, if the caller is responsible for the life-time of the data in question, then they may well wish to make modifications to table item passed back in the lh_doall() or lh_doall_arg() callbacks (see the \"TYPE_cleanup\" example above).

These extensions are denoted by individual bits in capability vector returned by processor in EDX:ECX register pair after executing CPUID instruction with EAX=1 input value (see Intel Application Note #241618). This vector is copied to memory upon toolkit initialization and used to choose between different code paths to provide optimal performance across wide range of processors. For the moment of this writing following bits are significant:</p> <ul> <li>bit #4 denoting presence of Time-Stamp Counter.</li> <li>bit #19 denoting availability of CLFLUSH instruction;</li> <li>bit #20, reserved by Intel, is used to choose among RC4 code paths;</li> <li>bit #23 denoting MMX support;</li> <li>bit #24, FXSR bit, denoting availability of XMM registers;</li> <li>bit #25 denoting SSE support;</li> <li>bit #26 denoting SSE2 support;</li> <li>bit #28 denoting Hyperthreading, which is used to distinguish cores with shared cache;</li> <li>bit #30, reserved by Intel, denotes specifically Intel CPUs;</li> <li>bit #33 denoting availability of PCLMULQDQ instruction;</li> <li>bit #41 denoting SSSE3, Supplemental SSE3, support;</li> <li>bit #43 denoting AMD XOP support (forced to zero on non-AMD CPUs);</li> <li>bit #54 denoting availability of MOVBE instruction;</li> <li>bit #57 denoting AES-NI instruction set extension;</li> <li>bit #58, XSAVE bit, lack of which in combination with MOVBE is used to identify Atom Silvermont core;</li> <li>bit #59, OSXSAVE bit, denoting availability of YMM registers;</li> <li>bit #60 denoting AVX extension;</li> <li>bit #62 denoting availability of RDRAND instruction;</li> </ul> <p>For example, in 32-bit application context clearing bit #26 at run-time disables high-performance SSE2 code present in the crypto library, while clearing bit #24 disables SSE2 code operating on 128-bit XMM register bank. You might have to do the latter if target OpenSSL application is executed on SSE2 capable CPU, but under control of OS that does not enable XMM registers. Historically address of the capability vector copy was exposed to application through OPENSSL_ia32cap_loc(), but not anymore. Now the only way to affect the capability detection is to set OPENSSL_ia32cap environment variable prior target application start. To give a specific example, on Intel P4 processor 'env OPENSSL_ia32cap=0x16980010 apps/openssl', or better yet 'env OPENSSL_ia32cap=~0x1000000 apps/openssl' would achieve the desired effect. Alternatively you can reconfigure the toolkit with no-sse2 option and recompile.</p> <p>Less intuitive is clearing bit #28, or ~0x10000000 in the \"environment variable\" terms. The truth is that it's not copied from CPUID output verbatim, but is adjusted to reflect whether or not the data cache is actually shared between logical cores. This in turn affects the decision on whether or not expensive countermeasures against cache-timing attacks are applied, most notably in AES assembler module.</p> <p>The capability vector is further extended with EBX value returned by CPUID with EAX=7 and ECX=0 as input. Following bits are significant:</p> <ul> <li>bit #64+3 denoting availability of BMI1 instructions, e.g. ANDN;</li> <li>bit #64+5 denoting availability of AVX2 instructions;</li> <li>bit #64+8 denoting availability of BMI2 instructions, e.g. MULX and RORX;</li> <li>bit #64+16 denoting availability of AVX512F extension;</li> <li>bit #64+18 denoting availability of RDSEED instruction;</li> <li>bit #64+19 denoting availability of ADCX and ADOX instructions;</li> <li>bit #64+21 denoting availability of VPMADD52[LH]UQ instructions, aka AVX512IFMA extension;</li> <li>bit #64+29 denoting availability of SHA extension;</li> <li>bit #64+30 denoting availability of AVX512BW extension;</li> <li>bit #64+31 denoting availability of AVX512VL extension;</li> <li>bit #64+41 denoting availability of VAES extension;</li> <li>bit #64+42 denoting availability of VPCLMULQDQ extension;</li> </ul> <p>To control this extended capability word use ':' as delimiter when setting up OPENSSL_ia32cap environment variable. For example assigning ':~0x20' would disable AVX2 code paths, and ':0' - all post-AVX extensions.</p> <p>It should be noted that whether or not some of the most \"fancy\" extension code paths are actually assembled depends on current assembler version. Base minimum of AES-NI/PCLMULQDQ, SSSE3 and SHA extension code paths are always assembled. Apart from that, minimum assembler version requirements are summarized in below table:</p> <pre><code>Extension   | GNU as | nasm   | llvm\n------------+--------+--------+--------\nAVX         | 2.19   | 2.09   | 3.0\nAVX2        | 2.22   | 2.10   | 3.1\nADCX/ADOX   | 2.23   | 2.10   | 3.3\nAVX512      | 2.25   | 2.11.8 | see NOTES\nAVX512IFMA  | 2.26   | 2.11.8 | see NOTES\nVAES        | 2.30   | 2.13.3 |\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"man3/OPENSSL_ia32cap/#notes","title":"NOTES","text":"<p>Even though AVX512 support was implemented in llvm 3.6, compilation of assembly modules apparently requires explicit -march flag.

Using this option suppresses that behaviour. This means that the application will have to clean up OpenSSL explicitly using OPENSSL_cleanup().</p> </li> </ul> <p>Multiple options may be combined together in a single call to OPENSSL_init_crypto(). For example:</p> <pre><code>OPENSSL_init_crypto(OPENSSL_INIT_NO_ADD_ALL_CIPHERS\n                    | OPENSSL_INIT_NO_ADD_ALL_DIGESTS, NULL);\n</code></pre> <p>The OPENSSL_cleanup() function deinitialises OpenSSL (both libcrypto and libssl). All resources allocated by OpenSSL are freed. Typically there should be no need to call this function directly as it is initiated automatically on application exit. This is done via the standard C library atexit() function. In the event that the application will close in a manner that will not call the registered atexit() handlers then the application should call OPENSSL_cleanup() directly. Developers of libraries using OpenSSL are discouraged from calling this function and should instead, typically, rely on auto-deinitialisation. This is to avoid error conditions where both an application and a library it depends on both use OpenSSL, and the library deinitialises it before the application has finished using it.</p> <p>Once OPENSSL_cleanup() has been called the library cannot be reinitialised. Attempts to call OPENSSL_init_crypto() will fail and an ERR_R_INIT_FAIL error will be added to the error stack. Note that because initialisation has failed OpenSSL error strings will not be available, only an error code. This code can be put through the openssl errstr command line application to produce a human readable error (see errstr(1)).</p> <p>The OPENSSL_atexit() function enables the registration of a function to be called during OPENSSL_cleanup(). Stop handlers are called after deinitialisation of resources local to a thread, but before other process wide resources are freed. In the event that multiple stop handlers are registered, no guarantees are made about the order of execution.</p> <p>The OPENSSL_thread_stop() function deallocates resources associated with the current thread. Typically this function will be called automatically by the library when the thread exits. This should only be called directly if resources should be freed at an earlier time, or under the circumstances described in the NOTES section below.</p> <p>The OPENSSL_INIT_LOAD_CONFIG flag will load a configuration file, as with CONF_modules_load_file(3) with NULL filename and application name and the CONF_MFLAGS_IGNORE_MISSING_FILE, CONF_MFLAGS_IGNORE_RETURN_CODES  and CONF_MFLAGS_DEFAULT_SECTION flags. The filename, application name, and flags can be customized by providing a non-null OPENSSL_INIT_SETTINGS object. The object can be allocated via OPENSSL_init_new(). The OPENSSL_INIT_set_config_filename() function can be used to specify a nondefault filename, which is copied and need not refer to persistent storage. Similarly, OPENSSL_INIT_set_config_appname() can be used to specify a nondefault application name. Finally, OPENSSL_INIT_set_file_flags can be used to specify nondefault flags. If the CONF_MFLAGS_IGNORE_RETURN_CODES flag is not included, any errors in the configuration file will cause an error return from OPENSSL_init_crypto or indirectly OPENSSL_init_ssl(3). The object can be released with OPENSSL_INIT_free() when done.</p>"},{"location":"man3/OPENSSL_init_crypto/#notes","title":"NOTES","text":"<p>Resources local to a thread are deallocated automatically when the thread exits (e.g. in a pthreads environment, when pthread_exit() is called). On Windows platforms this is done in response to a DLL_THREAD_DETACH message being sent to the libcrypto32.dll entry point. Some windows functions may cause threads to exit without sending this message (for example ExitProcess()). If the application uses such functions, then the application must free up OpenSSL resources directly via a call to OPENSSL_thread_stop() on each thread. Similarly this message will also not be sent if OpenSSL is linked statically, and therefore applications using static linking should also call OPENSSL_thread_stop() on each thread.

Use OPENSSL_cleanse() with care if the memory is a mapping of a file. If the storage controller uses write compression, then it's possible that sensitive tail bytes will survive zeroization because the block of zeros will be compressed.

With CRYPTO_set_mem_functions(), you can specify a different set of functions.

This adds some overhead by keeping a list of all memory allocations, and removes items from the list when they are free'd. This is most useful for identifying memory leaks. CRYPTO_set_mem_debug() turns this tracking on and off.  In order to have any effect, is must be called before any of the allocation functions (e.g., CRYPTO_malloc()) are called, and is therefore normally one of the first lines of main() in an application. CRYPTO_mem_ctrl() provides fine-grained control of memory leak tracking. To enable tracking call CRYPTO_mem_ctrl() with a mode argument of the CRYPTO_MEM_CHECK_ON. To disable tracking call CRYPTO_mem_ctrl() with a mode argument of the CRYPTO_MEM_CHECK_OFF.</p> <p>While checking memory, it can be useful to store additional context about what is being done. For example, identifying the field names when parsing a complicated data structure. OPENSSL_mem_debug_push() (which calls CRYPTO_mem_debug_push()) attaches an identifying string to the allocation stack. This must be a global or other static string; it is not copied. OPENSSL_mem_debug_pop() removes identifying state from the stack.</p> <p>At the end of the program, calling CRYPTO_mem_leaks() or CRYPTO_mem_leaks_fp() will report all \"leaked\" memory, writing it to the specified BIO b or FILE fp. These functions return 1 if there are no leaks, 0 if there are leaks and -1 if an error occurred.</p> <p>CRYPTO_mem_leaks_cb() does the same as CRYPTO_mem_leaks(), but instead of writing to a given BIO, the callback function is called for each output string with the string, length, and userdata u as the callback parameters.</p> <p>If the library is built with the <code>crypto-mdebug</code> option, then one function, CRYPTO_get_alloc_counts(), and two additional environment variables, OPENSSL_MALLOC_FAILURES and OPENSSL_MALLOC_FD, are available.</p> <p>The function CRYPTO_get_alloc_counts() fills in the number of times each of CRYPTO_malloc(), CRYPTO_realloc(), and CRYPTO_free() have been called, into the values pointed to by mcount, rcount, and fcount, respectively.  If a pointer is NULL, then the corresponding count is not stored.</p> <p>The variable OPENSSL_MALLOC_FAILURES controls how often allocations should fail. It is a set of fields separated by semicolons, which each field is a count (defaulting to zero) and an optional atsign and percentage (defaulting to 100).  If the count is zero, then it lasts forever.  For example, <code>100;@25</code> or <code>100@0;0@25</code> means the first 100 allocations pass, then all other allocations (until the program exits or crashes) have a 25% chance of failing.</p> <p>If the variable OPENSSL_MALLOC_FD is parsed as a positive integer, then it is taken as an open file descriptor, and a record of all allocations is written to that descriptor.  If an allocation will fail, and the platform supports it, then a backtrace will be written to the descriptor.  This can be useful because a malloc may fail but not be checked, and problems will only occur later.  The following example in classic shell syntax shows how to use this (will not work on all platforms):</p> <pre><code>OPENSSL_MALLOC_FAILURES='200;@10'\nexport OPENSSL_MALLOC_FAILURES\nOPENSSL_MALLOC_FD=3\nexport OPENSSL_MALLOC_FD\n...app invocation... 3&gt;/tmp/log$$\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"man3/OPENSSL_malloc/#return-values","title":"RETURN VALUES","text":"<p>OPENSSL_malloc_init(), OPENSSL_free(), OPENSSL_clear_free() CRYPTO_free(), CRYPTO_clear_free() and CRYPTO_get_mem_functions() return no value.</p> <p>CRYPTO_mem_leaks(), CRYPTO_mem_leaks_fp() and CRYPTO_mem_leaks_cb() return 1 if there are no leaks, 0 if there are leaks and -1 if an error occurred.</p> <p>OPENSSL_malloc(), OPENSSL_zalloc(), OPENSSL_realloc(), OPENSSL_clear_realloc(), CRYPTO_malloc(), CRYPTO_zalloc(), CRYPTO_realloc(), CRYPTO_clear_realloc(), OPENSSL_buf2hexstr(), OPENSSL_hexstr2buf(), OPENSSL_strdup(), and OPENSSL_strndup() return a pointer to allocated memory or NULL on error.</p> <p>CRYPTO_set_mem_functions() and CRYPTO_set_mem_debug() return 1 on success or 0 on failure (almost always because allocations have already happened).</p> <p>CRYPTO_mem_ctrl() returns -1 if an error occurred, otherwise the previous value of the mode.</p> <p>OPENSSL_mem_debug_push() and OPENSSL_mem_debug_pop() return 1 on success or 0 on failure.</p>"},{"location":"man3/OPENSSL_malloc/#notes","title":"NOTES","text":"<p>While it's permitted to swap out only a few and not all the functions with CRYPTO_set_mem_functions(), it's recommended to swap them all out at once.

It is a good idea to review the code and see if it addresses your threat model and concerns.</p> <p>If a secure heap is used, then private key BIGNUM values are stored there. This protects long-term storage of private keys, but will not necessarily put all intermediate values and computations there.</p> <p>CRYPTO_secure_malloc_init() creates the secure heap, with the specified <code>size</code> in bytes. The <code>minsize</code> parameter is the minimum size to allocate from the heap. Both <code>size</code> and <code>minsize</code> must be a power of two.</p> <p>CRYPTO_secure_malloc_initialized() indicates whether or not the secure heap as been initialized and is available.</p> <p>CRYPTO_secure_malloc_done() releases the heap and makes the memory unavailable to the process if all secure memory has been freed. It can take noticeably long to complete.</p> <p>OPENSSL_secure_malloc() allocates <code>num</code> bytes from the heap.

For example:</p> <pre><code>-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIICdg....\n... bhTQ==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n</code></pre> <p>Optional header line(s) may appear after the begin line, and their existence depends on the type of object being written or read.</p> <p>PEM_write() writes to the file fp, while PEM_write_bio() writes to the BIO bp.  The name is the name to use in the marker, the header is the header value or NULL, and data and len specify the data and its length.</p> <p>The final data buffer is typically an ASN.1 object which can be decoded with the d2i function appropriate to the type name; see d2i_X509(3) for examples.</p> <p>PEM_read() reads from the file fp, while PEM_read_bio() reads from the BIO bp. Both skip any non-PEM data that precedes the start of the next PEM object.

In this sense PEM format is simply base64 encoded data surrounded by header lines.</p> <p>For more details about the meaning of arguments see the PEM FUNCTION ARGUMENTS section.</p> <p>Each operation has four functions associated with it. For brevity the term \"TYPE functions\" will be used below to collectively refer to the PEM_read_bio_TYPE(), PEM_read_TYPE(), PEM_write_bio_TYPE(), and PEM_write_TYPE() functions.</p> <p>The PrivateKey functions read or write a private key in PEM format using an EVP_PKEY structure. The write routines use PKCS#8 private key format and are equivalent to PEM_write_bio_PKCS8PrivateKey().The read functions transparently handle traditional and PKCS#8 format encrypted and unencrypted keys.</p> <p>PEM_write_bio_PrivateKey_traditional() writes out a private key in the \"traditional\" format with a simple private key marker and should only be used for compatibility with legacy programs.</p> <p>PEM_write_bio_PKCS8PrivateKey() and PEM_write_PKCS8PrivateKey() write a private key in an EVP_PKEY structure in PKCS#8 EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo format using PKCS#5 v2.0 password based encryption algorithms. The cipher argument specifies the encryption algorithm to use: unlike some other PEM routines the encryption is applied at the PKCS#8 level and not in the PEM headers. If cipher is NULL then no encryption is used and a PKCS#8 PrivateKeyInfo structure is used instead.</p> <p>PEM_write_bio_PKCS8PrivateKey_nid() and PEM_write_PKCS8PrivateKey_nid() also write out a private key as a PKCS#8 EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo however it uses PKCS#5 v1.5 or PKCS#12 encryption algorithms instead. The algorithm to use is specified in the nid parameter and should be the NID of the corresponding OBJECT IDENTIFIER (see NOTES section).</p> <p>The PUBKEY functions process a public key using an EVP_PKEY structure. The public key is encoded as a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure.</p> <p>The RSAPrivateKey functions process an RSA private key using an RSA structure. The write routines uses traditional format. The read routines handles the same formats as the PrivateKey functions but an error occurs if the private key is not RSA.</p> <p>The RSAPublicKey functions process an RSA public key using an RSA structure. The public key is encoded using a PKCS#1 RSAPublicKey structure.</p> <p>The RSA_PUBKEY functions also process an RSA public key using an RSA structure. However, the public key is encoded using a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure and an error occurs if the public key is not RSA.</p> <p>The DSAPrivateKey functions process a DSA private key using a DSA structure. The write routines uses traditional format. The read routines handles the same formats as the PrivateKey functions but an error occurs if the private key is not DSA.</p> <p>The DSA_PUBKEY functions process a DSA public key using a DSA structure. The public key is encoded using a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure and an error occurs if the public key is not DSA.</p> <p>The Parameters functions read or write key parameters in PEM format using an EVP_PKEY structure.  The encoding depends on the type of key; for DSA key parameters, it will be a Dss-Parms structure as defined in RFC2459, and for DH key parameters, it will be a PKCS#3 DHparameter structure.  These functions only exist for the BIO type.</p> <p>The DSAparams functions process DSA parameters using a DSA structure. The parameters are encoded using a Dss-Parms structure as defined in RFC2459.</p> <p>The DHparams functions process DH parameters using a DH structure. The parameters are encoded using a PKCS#3 DHparameter structure.</p> <p>The X509 functions process an X509 certificate using an X509 structure. They will also process a trusted X509 certificate but any trust settings are discarded.</p> <p>The X509_AUX functions process a trusted X509 certificate using an X509 structure.</p> <p>The X509_REQ and X509_REQ_NEW functions process a PKCS#10 certificate request using an X509_REQ structure. The X509_REQ write functions use CERTIFICATE REQUEST in the header whereas the X509_REQ_NEW functions use NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST (as required by some CAs). The X509_REQ read functions will handle either form so there are no X509_REQ_NEW read functions.</p> <p>The X509_CRL functions process an X509 CRL using an X509_CRL structure.</p> <p>The PKCS7 functions process a PKCS#7 ContentInfo using a PKCS7 structure.</p>"},{"location":"man3/PEM_read_bio_PrivateKey/#pem-function-arguments","title":"PEM FUNCTION ARGUMENTS","text":"<p>The PEM functions have many common arguments.</p> <p>The bp BIO parameter (if present) specifies the BIO to read from or write to.</p> <p>The fp FILE parameter (if present) specifies the FILE pointer to read from or write to.</p> <p>The PEM read functions all take an argument TYPE **x and return a TYPE * pointer. Where TYPE is whatever structure the function uses. If x is NULL then the parameter is ignored. If x is not NULL but *x is NULL then the structure returned will be written to *x. If neither x nor *x is NULL then an attempt is made to reuse the structure at *x (but see BUGS and EXAMPLES sections). Irrespective of the value of x a pointer to the structure is always returned (or NULL if an error occurred).</p> <p>The PEM functions which write private keys take an enc parameter which specifies the encryption algorithm to use, encryption is done at the PEM level. If this parameter is set to NULL then the private key is written in unencrypted form.</p> <p>The cb argument is the callback to use when querying for the pass phrase used for encrypted PEM structures (normally only private keys).</p> <p>For the PEM write routines if the kstr parameter is not NULL then klen bytes at kstr are used as the passphrase and cb is ignored.</p> <p>If the cb parameters is set to NULL and the u parameter is not NULL then the u parameter is interpreted as a null terminated string to use as the passphrase. If both cb and u are NULL then the default callback routine is used which will typically prompt for the passphrase on the current terminal with echoing turned off.</p> <p>The default passphrase callback is sometimes inappropriate (for example in a GUI application) so an alternative can be supplied.

A typical routine will ask the user to verify the passphrase (for example by prompting for it twice) if rwflag is 1. The u parameter has the same value as the u parameter passed to the PEM routine. It allows arbitrary data to be passed to the callback by the application (for example a window handle in a GUI application).

Otherwise indata should be NULL, and then the signed data must be in p7. The content is written to the BIO out unless it is NULL. flags is an optional set of flags, which can be used to modify the operation.</p> <p>PKCS7_get0_signers() retrieves the signer's certificates from p7, it does not check their validity or whether any signatures are valid.

The type of p7 must be SignedData. There must be at least one signature on the data and if the content is detached indata cannot be NULL.  If the content is not detached and indata is not NULL then the structure has both embedded and external content. To treat this as an error, use the flag PKCS7_NO_DUAL_CONTENT. The default behavior allows this, for compatibility with older versions of OpenSSL.</p> <p>An attempt is made to locate all the signer's certificates, first looking in the certs parameter (if it is not NULL). Then they are looked up in any certificates contained in the p7 structure unless PKCS7_NOINTERN is set. If any signer's certificates cannot be located the operation fails.</p> <p>Each signer's certificate is chain verified using the smimesign purpose and using the trusted certificate store store if supplied. Any internal certificates in the message, which may have been added using PKCS7_add_certificate(3), are used as untrusted CAs unless PKCS7_NOCHAIN is set. If CRL checking is enabled in store and PKCS7_NOCRL is not set, any internal CRLs, which may have been added using PKCS7_add_crl(3), are used in addition to attempting to look them up in store. If store is not NULL and any chain verify fails an error code is returned.</p> <p>Finally the signed content is read (and written to out unless it is NULL) and the signature is checked.</p> <p>If all signatures verify correctly then the function is successful.</p> <p>Any of the following flags (ored together) can be passed in the flags parameter to change the default verify behaviour. Only the flag PKCS7_NOINTERN is meaningful to PKCS7_get0_signers().</p> <p>If PKCS7_NOINTERN is set the certificates in the message itself are not searched when locating the signer's certificates. This means that all the signer's certificates must be in the certs parameter.</p> <p>If PKCS7_NOCRL is set and CRL checking is enabled in store then any CRLs in the message itself are ignored.</p> <p>If the PKCS7_TEXT flag is set MIME headers for type <code>text/plain</code> are deleted from the content.

Individual connections associated with the context can then enable per-connection DANE support as appropriate. DANE authentication is implemented in the X509_verify_cert(3) function, and applications that override X509_verify_cert(3) via SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(3) are responsible to authenticate the peer chain in whatever manner they see fit.</p> <p>SSL_CTX_dane_mtype_set() may then be called zero or more times to adjust the supported digest algorithms. This must be done before any SSL handles are created for the context.</p> <p>The mtype argument specifies a DANE TLSA matching type and the md argument specifies the associated digest algorithm handle. The ord argument specifies a strength ordinal. Algorithms with a larger strength ordinal are considered more secure. Strength ordinals are used to implement RFC7671 digest algorithm agility. Specifying a NULL digest algorithm for a matching type disables support for that matching type. Matching type Full(0) cannot be modified or disabled.</p> <p>By default, matching type <code>SHA2-256(1)</code> (see RFC7218 for definitions of the DANE TLSA parameter acronyms) is mapped to <code>EVP_sha256()</code> with a strength ordinal of <code>1</code> and matching type <code>SHA2-512(2)</code> is mapped to <code>EVP_sha512()</code> with a strength ordinal of <code>2</code>.</p> <p>SSL_dane_enable() must be called before the SSL handshake is initiated with SSL_connect(3) if (and only if) you want to enable DANE for that connection. (The connection must be associated with a DANE-enabled SSL context). The basedomain argument specifies the RFC7671 TLSA base domain, which will be the primary peer reference identifier for certificate name checks. Additional server names can be specified via SSL_add1_host(3). The basedomain is used as the default SNI hint if none has yet been specified via SSL_set_tlsext_host_name(3).</p> <p>SSL_dane_tlsa_add() may then be called one or more times, to load each of the TLSA records that apply to the remote TLS peer. (This too must be done prior to the beginning of the SSL handshake). The arguments specify the fields of the TLSA record. The data field is provided in binary (wire RDATA) form, not the hexadecimal ASCII presentation form, with an explicit length passed via dlen. The library takes a copy of the data buffer contents and the caller may free the original data buffer when convenient. A return value of 0 indicates that \"unusable\" TLSA records (with invalid or unsupported parameters) were provided. A negative return value indicates an internal error in processing the record.</p> <p>The caller is expected to check the return value of each SSL_dane_tlsa_add() call and take appropriate action if none are usable or an internal error is encountered in processing some records.</p> <p>If no TLSA records are added successfully, DANE authentication is not enabled, and authentication will be based on any configured traditional trust-anchors; authentication success in this case does not mean that the peer was DANE-authenticated.</p> <p>SSL_get0_dane_authority() can be used to get more detailed information about the matched DANE trust-anchor after successful connection completion. The return value is negative if DANE verification failed (or was not enabled), 0 if an EE TLSA record directly matched the leaf certificate, or a positive number indicating the depth at which a TA record matched an issuer certificate. The complete verified chain can be retrieved via SSL_get0_verified_chain(3). The return value is an index into this verified chain, rather than the list of certificates sent by the peer as returned by SSL_get_peer_cert_chain(3).</p> <p>If the mcert argument is not NULL and a TLSA record matched a chain certificate, a pointer to the matching certificate is returned via mcert. The returned address is a short-term internal reference to the certificate and must not be freed by the application. Applications that want to retain access to the certificate can call X509_up_ref(3) to obtain a long-term reference which must then be freed via X509_free(3) once no longer needed.</p> <p>If no TLSA records directly matched any elements of the certificate chain, but a DANE-TA(2) SPKI(1) Full(0) record provided the public key that signed an element of the chain, then that key is returned via mspki argument (if not NULL). In this case the return value is the depth of the top-most element of the validated certificate chain. As with mcert this is a short-term internal reference, and EVP_PKEY_up_ref(3) and EVP_PKEY_free(3) can be used to acquire and release long-term references respectively.</p> <p>SSL_get0_dane_tlsa() can be used to retrieve the fields of the TLSA record that matched the peer certificate chain. The return value indicates the match depth or failure to match just as with SSL_get0_dane_authority(). When the return value is nonnegative, the storage pointed to by the usage, selector, mtype and data parameters is updated to the corresponding TLSA record fields. The data field is in binary wire form, and is therefore not NUL-terminated, its length is returned via the dlen parameter. If any of these parameters is NULL, the corresponding field is not returned. The data parameter is set to a short-term internal-copy of the associated data field and must not be freed by the application. Applications that need long-term access to this field need to copy the content.</p> <p>SSL_CTX_dane_set_flags() and SSL_dane_set_flags() can be used to enable optional DANE verification features. SSL_CTX_dane_clear_flags() and SSL_dane_clear_flags() can be used to disable the same features. The flags argument is a bit mask of the features to enable or disable. The flags set for an SSL_CTX context are copied to each SSL handle associated with that context at the time the handle is created. Subsequent changes in the context's flags have no effect on the flags set for the handle.</p> <p>At present, the only available option is DANE_FLAG_NO_DANE_EE_NAMECHECKS which can be used to disable server name checks when authenticating via DANE-EE(3) TLSA records. For some applications, primarily web browsers, it is not safe to disable name checks due to \"unknown key share\" attacks, in which a malicious server can convince a client that a connection to a victim server is instead a secure connection to the malicious server.

Inside these callback functions, session can be saved to disk or put into a database using the d2i_SSL_SESSION(3) interface.</p> <p>The new_session_cb() is called whenever a new session has been negotiated and session caching is enabled (see SSL_CTX_set_session_cache_mode(3)).  The new_session_cb() is passed the ssl connection and the nascent ssl session sess. Since sessions are reference-counted objects, the reference count on the session is incremented before the callback, on behalf of the application.  If the callback returns 0, the session will be immediately removed from the internal cache and the reference count released. If the callback returns 1, the application retains the reference (for an entry in the application-maintained \"external session cache\"), and is responsible for calling SSL_SESSION_free() when the session reference is no longer in use.</p> <p>Note that in TLSv1.3, sessions are established after the main handshake has completed. The server decides when to send the client the session information and this may occur some time after the end of the handshake (or not at all). This means that applications should expect the new_session_cb() function to be invoked during the handshake (for &lt;= TLSv1.2) or after the handshake (for TLSv1.3). It is also possible in TLSv1.3 for multiple sessions to be established with a single connection. In these case the new_session_cb() function will be invoked multiple times.</p> <p>In TLSv1.3 it is recommended that each SSL_SESSION object is only used for resumption once. One way of enforcing that is for applications to call SSL_CTX_remove_session(3) after a session has been used.</p> <p>The remove_session_cb() is called whenever the SSL engine removes a session from the internal cache. This can happen when the session is removed because it is expired or when a connection was not shutdown cleanly. It also happens for all sessions in the internal session cache when SSL_CTX_free(3) is called. The remove_session_cb() is passed the ctx and the ssl session sess. It does not provide any feedback.</p> <p>The get_session_cb() is only called on SSL/TLS servers, and is given the session id proposed by the client. The get_session_cb() is always called, even when session caching was disabled. The get_session_cb() is passed the ssl connection and the session id of length length at the memory location data. By setting the parameter copy to 1, the callback can require the SSL engine to increment the reference count of the SSL_SESSION object; setting copy to 0 causes the reference count to remain unchanged.

So any list of CA names set is never sent from client to server and the list of CA names retrieved by SSL_get0_peer_CA_list() is always NULL.</p> <p>For TLS 1.3 the list of CA names is sent using the certificate_authorities extension and may be sent by a client (in the ClientHello message) or by a server (when requesting a certificate).</p> <p>In most cases it is not necessary to set CA names on the client side. The list of CA names that are acceptable to the client will be sent in plaintext to the server. This has privacy implications and may also have performance implications if the list is large. This optional capability was introduced as part of TLSv1.3 and therefore setting CA names on the client side will have no impact if that protocol version has been disabled. Most servers do not need this and so this should be avoided unless required.</p> <p>The \"client CA list\" functions below only have an effect when called on the server side.</p> <p>SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list() sets the list of CAs sent to the client when requesting a client certificate for ctx. Ownership of list is transferred to ctx and it should not be freed by the caller.</p> <p>SSL_set_client_CA_list() sets the list of CAs sent to the client when requesting a client certificate for the chosen ssl, overriding the setting valid for ssl's SSL_CTX object. Ownership of list is transferred to s and it should not be freed by the caller.</p> <p>SSL_CTX_get_client_CA_list() returns the list of client CAs explicitly set for ctx using SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(). The returned list should not be freed by the caller.</p> <p>SSL_get_client_CA_list() returns the list of client CAs explicitly set for ssl using SSL_set_client_CA_list() or ssl's SSL_CTX object with SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(), when in server mode. In client mode, SSL_get_client_CA_list returns the list of client CAs sent from the server, if any. The returned list should not be freed by the caller.</p> <p>SSL_CTX_add_client_CA() adds the CA name extracted from cacert to the list of CAs sent to the client when requesting a client certificate for ctx.</p> <p>SSL_add_client_CA() adds the CA name extracted from cacert to the list of CAs sent to the client when requesting a client certificate for the chosen ssl, overriding the setting valid for ssl's SSL_CTX object.</p> <p>SSL_get0_peer_CA_list() retrieves the list of CA names (if any) the peer has sent. This can be called on either the server or the client side. The returned list should not be freed by the caller.</p> <p>The \"generic CA list\" functions below are very similar to the \"client CA list\" functions except that they have an effect on both the server and client sides. The lists of CA names managed are separate - so you cannot (for example) set CA names using the \"client CA list\" functions and then get them using the \"generic CA list\" functions. Where a mix of the two types of functions has been used on the server side then the \"client CA list\" functions take precedence. Typically, on the server side, the \"client CA list \" functions should be used in preference.

The session id is an arbitrary sequence of bytes. The length of the session id is between 1 and 32 bytes.  The session id is not security critical but must be unique for the server. Additionally, the session id is transmitted in the clear when reusing the session so it must not contain sensitive information.</p> <p>Without a callback being set, an OpenSSL server will generate a unique session id from pseudo random numbers of the maximum possible length. Using the callback function, the session id can be changed to contain additional information like e.g. a host id in order to improve load balancing or external caching techniques.</p> <p>The callback function receives a pointer to the memory location to put id into and a pointer to the maximum allowed length id_len. The buffer at location id is only guaranteed to have the size id_len. The callback is only allowed to generate a shorter id and reduce id_len; the callback must never increase id_len or write to the location id exceeding the given limit.</p> <p>The location id is filled with 0x00 before the callback is called, so the callback may only fill part of the possible length and leave id_len untouched while maintaining reproducibility.</p> <p>Since the sessions must be distinguished, session ids must be unique. Without the callback a random number is used, so that the probability of generating the same session id is extremely small (2^256 for SSLv3/TLSv1). In order to assure the uniqueness of the generated session id, the callback must call SSL_has_matching_session_id() and generate another id if a conflict occurs. If an id conflict is not resolved, the handshake will fail. If the application codes e.g. a unique host id, a unique process number, and a unique sequence number into the session id, uniqueness could easily be achieved without randomness added (it should however be taken care that no confidential information is leaked this way). If the application can not guarantee uniqueness, it is recommended to use the maximum id_len and fill in the bytes not used to code special information with random data to avoid collisions.</p> <p>SSL_has_matching_session_id() will only query the internal session cache, not the external one. Since the session id is generated before the handshake is completed, it is not immediately added to the cache. If another thread is using the same internal session cache, a race condition can occur in that another thread generates the same session id. Collisions can also occur when using an external session cache, since the external cache is not tested with SSL_has_matching_session_id() and the same race condition applies.</p> <p>The callback must return 0 if it cannot generate a session id for whatever reason and return 1 on success.</p>"},{"location":"man3/SSL_CTX_set_generate_session_id/#return-values","title":"RETURN VALUES","text":"<p>SSL_CTX_set_generate_session_id() and SSL_set_generate_session_id() always return 1.</p> <p>SSL_has_matching_session_id() returns 1 if another session with the same id is already in the cache.</p>"},{"location":"man3/SSL_CTX_set_generate_session_id/#examples","title":"EXAMPLES","text":"<p>The callback function listed will generate a session id with the server id given, and will fill the rest with pseudo random bytes:</p> <pre><code>const char session_id_prefix = \"www-18\";\n\n#define MAX_SESSION_ID_ATTEMPTS 10\nstatic int generate_session_id(SSL *ssl, unsigned char *id,\n                               unsigned int *id_len)\n{\n    unsigned int count = 0;\n\n    do {\n        RAND_pseudo_bytes(id, *id_len);\n        /*\n         * Prefix the session_id with the required prefix.

This works in a similar way for SSL_write(). When not set (the default), SSL_write_ex() or SSL_write() will only report success once the complete chunk was written.

If a non-application data record was processed, SSL_read_ex(3) and SSL_read(3) can return with a failure and indicate the need to retry with SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ. If such a non-application data record was processed, the flag SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY causes it to try to process the next record instead of returning.</p> <p>In a nonblocking environment applications must be prepared to handle incomplete read/write operations. Setting SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY for a nonblocking BIO will process non-application data records until either no more data is available or an application data record has been processed.</p> <p>In a blocking environment, applications are not always prepared to deal with the functions returning intermediate reports such as retry requests, and setting the SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY flag will cause the functions to only return after successfully processing an application data record or a failure.</p> <p>Turning off SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY can be useful with blocking BIOs in case they are used in combination with something like select() or poll().

Only affects DTLS connections.</p> </li> <li> <p>SSL_OP_NO_TICKET</p> <p>SSL/TLS supports two mechanisms for resuming sessions: session ids and stateless session tickets.</p> <p>When using session ids a copy of the session information is cached on the server and a unique id is sent to the client. When the client wishes to resume it provides the unique id so that the server can retrieve the session information from its cache.</p> <p>When using stateless session tickets the server uses a session ticket encryption key to encrypt the session information. This encrypted data is sent to the client as a \"ticket\". When the client wishes to resume it sends the encrypted data back to the server. The server uses its key to decrypt the data and resume the session. In this way the server can operate statelessly - no session information needs to be cached locally.</p> <p>The TLSv1.3 protocol only supports tickets and does not directly support session ids. However, OpenSSL allows two modes of ticket operation in TLSv1.3: stateful and stateless. Stateless tickets work the same way as in TLSv1.2 and below. Stateful tickets mimic the session id behaviour available in TLSv1.2 and below. The session information is cached on the server and the session id is wrapped up in a ticket and sent back to the client. When the client wishes to resume, it presents a ticket in the same way as for stateless tickets. The server can then extract the session id from the ticket and retrieve the session information from its cache.</p> <p>By default OpenSSL will use stateless tickets. The SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option will cause stateless tickets to not be issued. In TLSv1.2 and below this means no ticket gets sent to the client at all. In TLSv1.3 a stateful ticket will be sent. This is a server-side option only.</p> <p>In TLSv1.3 it is possible to suppress all tickets (stateful and stateless) from being sent by calling SSL_CTX_set_num_tickets(3) or SSL_set_num_tickets(3).</p> </li> <li> <p>SSL_OP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION</p> <p>Allow legacy insecure renegotiation between OpenSSL and unpatched clients or servers.

Clients will not propose, and servers will not accept the extension.</p> </li> <li> <p>SSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION</p> <p>Disable all renegotiation in TLSv1.2 and earlier. Do not send HelloRequest messages, and ignore renegotiation requests via ClientHello.</p> </li> <li> <p>SSL_OP_ALLOW_NO_DHE_KEX</p> <p>In TLSv1.3 allow a non-(ec)dhe based key exchange mode on resumption. This means that there will be no forward secrecy for the resumed session.</p> </li> <li> <p>SSL_OP_PRIORITIZE_CHACHA</p> <p>When SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE is set, temporarily reprioritize ChaCha20-Poly1305 ciphers to the top of the server cipher list if a ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher is at the top of the client cipher list. This helps those clients (e.g. mobile) use ChaCha20-Poly1305 if that cipher is anywhere in the server cipher list; but still allows other clients to use AES and other ciphers. Requires SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE.</p> </li> <li> <p>SSL_OP_ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT</p> <p>If set then dummy Change Cipher Spec (CCS) messages are sent in TLSv1.3. This has the effect of making TLSv1.3 look more like TLSv1.2 so that middleboxes that do not understand TLSv1.3 will not drop the connection. Regardless of whether this option is set or not CCS messages received from the peer will always be ignored in TLSv1.3. This option is set by default. To switch it off use SSL_clear_options(). A future version of OpenSSL may not set this by default.</p> </li> <li> <p>SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY</p> <p>By default, when a server is configured for early data (i.e., max_early_data &gt; 0), OpenSSL will switch on replay protection. See SSL_read_early_data(3) for a description of the replay protection feature. Anti-replay measures are required to comply with the TLSv1.3 specification. Some applications may be able to mitigate the replay risks in other ways and in such cases the built in OpenSSL functionality is not required. Those applications can turn this feature off by setting this option. This is a server-side opton only.

In some circumstances the callback will be called a second time. In that case the server will have specified a ciphersuite to use already and the PSK must be compatible with the digest for that ciphersuite. The digest will be given in md.

The identifier length in bytes should be stored in *idlen. The memory pointed to by *id remains owned by the application and should be freed by it as required at any point after the handshake is complete.</p> <p>Additionally the callback should store a pointer to an SSL_SESSION object in *sess. This is used as the basis for the PSK, and should, at a minimum, have the following fields set:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The master key</p> <p>This can be set via a call to SSL_SESSION_set1_master_key(3).</p> </li> <li> <p>A ciphersuite</p> <p>Only the handshake digest associated with the ciphersuite is relevant for the PSK (the server may go on to negotiate any ciphersuite which is compatible with the digest).

The handshake digest of an SSL_CIPHER object can be checked using . <li> <p>The protocol version</p> <p>This can be set via a call to SSL_SESSION_set_protocol_version(3) and should be TLS1_3_VERSION.</p> </li> <p>Additionally the maximum early data value should be set via a call to SSL_SESSION_set_max_early_data(3) if the PSK will be used for sending early data.</p> <p>Alternatively an SSL_SESSION created from a previous non-PSK handshake may also be used as the basis for a PSK.</p> <p>Ownership of the SSL_SESSION object is passed to the OpenSSL library and so it should not be freed by the application.</p> <p>It is also possible for the callback to succeed but not supply a PSK. In this case no PSK will be sent to the server but the handshake will continue. To do this the callback should return successfully and ensure that *sess is NULL.

If no such callback is present then it will check to see if a callback has been set via SSL_CTX_set_psk_client_callback() or SSL_set_psk_client_callback() and use that. In this case the hint value will always be NULL and the handshake digest will default to SHA-256 for any returned PSK.

The number of pipelines set must be in the range 1 - SSL_MAX_PIPELINES (32). Setting this to a value &gt; 1 will also automatically turn on \"read_ahead\" (see SSL_CTX_set_read_ahead(3)). This is explained further below. OpenSSL will only every use more than one pipeline if a cipher suite is negotiated that uses a pipeline capable cipher provided by an engine.</p> <p>Pipelining operates slightly differently for reading encrypted data compared to writing encrypted data. SSL_CTX_set_split_send_fragment() and SSL_set_split_send_fragment() define how data is split up into pipelines when writing encrypted data. The number of pipelines used will be determined by the amount of data provided to the SSL_write_ex() or SSL_write() call divided by split_send_fragment.</p> <p>For example if split_send_fragment is set to 2000 and max_pipelines is 4 then:</p> <p>SSL_write/SSL_write_ex called with 0-2000 bytes == 1 pipeline used</p> <p>SSL_write/SSL_write_ex called with 2001-4000 bytes == 2 pipelines used</p> <p>SSL_write/SSL_write_ex called with 4001-6000 bytes == 3 pipelines used</p> <p>SSL_write/SSL_write_ex called with 6001+ bytes == 4 pipelines used</p> <p>split_send_fragment must always be less than or equal to max_send_fragment. By default it is set to be equal to max_send_fragment. This will mean that the same number of records will always be created as would have been created in the non-parallel case, although the data will be apportioned differently. In the parallel case data will be spread equally between the pipelines.</p> <p>Read pipelining is controlled in a slightly different way than with write pipelining. While reading we are constrained by the number of records that the peer (and the network) can provide to us in one go. The more records we can get in one go the more opportunity we have to parallelise the processing. As noted above when setting max_pipelines to a value greater than one, read_ahead is automatically set. The read_ahead parameter causes OpenSSL to attempt to read as much data into the read buffer as the network can provide and will fit into the buffer. Without this set data is read into the read buffer one record at a time. The more data that can be read, the more opportunity there is for parallelising the processing at the cost of increased memory overhead per connection. Setting read_ahead can impact the behaviour of the SSL_pending() function (see SSL_pending(3)).</p> <p>The SSL_CTX_set_default_read_buffer_len() and SSL_set_default_read_buffer_len() functions control the size of the read buffer that will be used. The len parameter sets the size of the buffer. The value will only be used if it is greater than the default that would have been used anyway. The normal default value depends on a number of factors but it will be at least SSL3_RT_MAX_PLAIN_LENGTH + SSL3_RT_MAX_ENCRYPTED_OVERHEAD (16704) bytes.</p> <p>SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_max_fragment_length() sets the default maximum fragment length negotiation mode via value mode to ctx. This setting affects only SSL instances created after this function is called. It affects the client-side as only its side may initiate this extension use.</p> <p>SSL_set_tlsext_max_fragment_length() sets the maximum fragment length negotiation mode via value mode to ssl. This setting will be used during a handshake when extensions are exchanged between client and server. So it only affects SSL sessions created after this function is called. It affects the client-side as only its side may initiate this extension use.</p> <p>SSL_SESSION_get_max_fragment_length() gets the maximum fragment length negotiated in session.</p>"},{"location":"man3/SSL_CTX_set_split_send_fragment/#return-values","title":"RETURN VALUES","text":"<p>All non-void functions return 1 on success and 0 on failure.</p>"},{"location":"man3/SSL_CTX_set_split_send_fragment/#notes","title":"NOTES","text":"<p>The Maximum Fragment Length extension support is optional on the server side.

This allows the SSL_CTX or SSL to be configured for post-handshake peer verification before the handshake occurs. This flag must be used together with SSL_VERIFY_PEER. TLSv1.3 only; no effect on pre-TLSv1.3 connections.</p> <p>Client mode: ignored (see BUGS)</p> </li> </ul> <p>If the mode is SSL_VERIFY_NONE none of the other flags may be set.</p> <p>The actual verification procedure is performed either using the built-in verification procedure or using another application provided verification function set with SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(3). The following descriptions apply in the case of the built-in procedure. An application provided procedure also has access to the verify depth information and the verify_callback() function, but the way this information is used may be different.</p> <p>SSL_CTX_set_verify_depth() and SSL_set_verify_depth() set a limit on the number of certificates between the end-entity and trust-anchor certificates. Neither the end-entity nor the trust-anchor certificates count against depth. If the certificate chain needed to reach a trusted issuer is longer than depth+2, X509_V_ERR_CERT_CHAIN_TOO_LONG will be issued. The depth count is \"level 0:peer certificate\", \"level 1: CA certificate\", \"level 2: higher level CA certificate\", and so on. Setting the maximum depth to 2 allows the levels 0, 1, 2 and 3 (0 being the end-entity and 3 the trust-anchor). The default depth limit is 100, allowing for the peer certificate, at most 100 intermediate CA certificates and a final trust anchor certificate.</p> <p>The verify_callback function is used to control the behaviour when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER flag is set. It must be supplied by the application and receives two arguments: preverify_ok indicates, whether the verification of the certificate in question was passed (preverify_ok=1) or not (preverify_ok=0). x509_ctx is a pointer to the complete context used for the certificate chain verification.</p> <p>The certificate chain is checked starting with the deepest nesting level (the root CA certificate) and worked upward to the peer's certificate. At each level signatures and issuer attributes are checked. Whenever a verification error is found, the error number is stored in x509_ctx and verify_callback is called with preverify_ok=0. By applying X509_CTX_store_* functions verify_callback can locate the certificate in question and perform additional steps (see EXAMPLES). If no error is found for a certificate, verify_callback is called with preverify_ok=1 before advancing to the next level.</p> <p>The return value of verify_callback controls the strategy of the further verification process. If verify_callback returns 0, the verification process is immediately stopped with \"verification failed\" state. If SSL_VERIFY_PEER is set, a verification failure alert is sent to the peer and the TLS/SSL handshake is terminated. If verify_callback returns 1, the verification process is continued. If verify_callback always returns 1, the TLS/SSL handshake will not be terminated with respect to verification failures and the connection will be established. The calling process can however retrieve the error code of the last verification error using SSL_get_verify_result(3) or by maintaining its own error storage managed by verify_callback.</p> <p>If no verify_callback is specified, the default callback will be used. Its return value is identical to preverify_ok, so that any verification failure will lead to a termination of the TLS/SSL handshake with an alert message, if SSL_VERIFY_PEER is set.</p> <p>After calling SSL_set_post_handshake_auth(), the client will need to add a certificate or certificate callback to its configuration before it can successfully authenticate. This must be called before SSL_connect().</p> <p>SSL_verify_client_post_handshake() requires that verify flags have been previously set, and that a client sent the post-handshake authentication extension. When the client returns a certificate the verify callback will be invoked. A write operation must take place for the Certificate Request to be sent to the client, this can be done with SSL_do_handshake() or SSL_write_ex(). Only one certificate request may be outstanding at any time.</p> <p>When post-handshake authentication occurs, a refreshed NewSessionTicket message is sent to the client.</p>"},{"location":"man3/SSL_CTX_set_verify/#bugs","title":"BUGS","text":"<p>In client mode, it is not checked whether the SSL_VERIFY_PEER flag is set, but whether any flags other than SSL_VERIFY_NONE are set.

A server application wishing to use PSK ciphersuites for TLSv1.2 and below may call SSL_CTX_use_psk_identity_hint() to set the given NUL-terminated PSK identity hint hint for SSL context object ctx. SSL_use_psk_identity_hint() sets the given NUL-terminated PSK identity hint hint for the SSL connection object ssl.

The callback is set using the functions SSL_CTX_set_psk_server_callback() or SSL_set_psk_server_callback().

The server will send the session information to the client at a time of its choosing, which may be some while after the initial connection is established (or never). Calling these functions on the client side in TLSv1.3 before the session has been established will still return an SSL_SESSION object but that object cannot be used for resuming the session. See SSL_SESSION_is_resumable(3) for information on how to determine whether an SSL_SESSION object can be used for resumption or not.</p> <p>Additionally, in TLSv1.3, a server can send multiple messages that establish a session for a single connection. In that case, on the client side, the above functions will only return information on the last session that was received. On the server side they will only return information on the last session that was sent, or if no session tickets were sent then the session for the current connection.</p> <p>The preferred way for applications to obtain a resumable SSL_SESSION object is to use a new session callback as described in SSL_CTX_sess_set_new_cb(3). The new session callback is only invoked when a session is actually established, so this avoids the problem described above where an application obtains an SSL_SESSION object that cannot be used for resumption in TLSv1.3. It also enables applications to obtain information about all sessions sent by the server.</p> <p>A session will be automatically removed from the session cache and marked as non-resumable if the connection is not closed down cleanly, e.g. if a fatal error occurs on the connection or SSL_shutdown(3) is not called prior to SSL_free(3).</p> <p>In TLSv1.3 it is recommended that each SSL_SESSION object is only used for resumption once.</p> <p>SSL_get0_session() returns a pointer to the actual session.

If SSL_clear(3) or SSL_free(3) is called, the session may be removed completely (if considered bad), and the pointer obtained will become invalid. Even if the session is valid, it can be removed at any time due to timeout during SSL_CTX_flush_sessions(3).</p> <p>If the data is to be kept, SSL_get1_session() will increment the reference count, so that the session will not be implicitly removed by other operations but stays in memory. In order to remove the session SSL_SESSION_free(3) must be explicitly called once to decrement the reference count again.</p> <p>SSL_SESSION objects keep internal link information about the session cache list, when being inserted into one SSL_CTX object's session cache.

If the peer requests a re-negotiation, it will be performed transparently during the read function operation. The behaviour of the read functions depends on the underlying BIO.</p> <p>For the transparent negotiation to succeed, the ssl must have been initialized to client or server mode. This is being done by calling SSL_set_connect_state(3) or SSL_set_accept_state() before the first invocation of a read function.</p> <p>The read functions work based on the SSL/TLS records. The data are received in records (with a maximum record size of 16kB). Only when a record has been completely received, can it be processed (decryption and check of integrity). Therefore, data that was not retrieved at the last read call can still be buffered inside the SSL layer and will be retrieved on the next read call. If num is higher than the number of bytes buffered then the read functions will return with the bytes buffered. If no more bytes are in the buffer, the read functions will trigger the processing of the next record. Only when the record has been received and processed completely will the read functions return reporting success. At most the contents of one record will be returned. As the size of an SSL/TLS record may exceed the maximum packet size of the underlying transport (e.g. TCP), it may be necessary to read several packets from the transport layer before the record is complete and the read call can succeed.</p> <p>If SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY has been switched off and a non-application data record has been processed, the read function can return and set the error to SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ. In this case there might still be unprocessed data available in the BIO. If read ahead was set using SSL_CTX_set_read_ahead(3), there might also still be unprocessed data available in the SSL.

In this case a call to SSL_get_error(3) with the return value of the read function will yield SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE. As at any time it's possible that non-application data needs to be sent, a read function can also cause write operations. The calling process then must repeat the call after taking appropriate action to satisfy the needs of the read function. The action depends on the underlying BIO. When using a nonblocking socket, nothing is to be done, but select() can be used to check for the required condition. When using a buffering BIO, like a BIO pair, data must be written into or retrieved out of the BIO before being able to continue.</p> <p>SSL_pending(3) can be used to find out whether there are buffered bytes available for immediate retrieval.

Early data can be sent by the client immediately after its initial ClientHello without having to wait for the server to complete the handshake. Early data can be sent if a session has previously been established with the server or when establishing a new session using an out-of-band PSK, and only when the server is known to support it. Additionally these functions can be used to send data from the server to the client when the client has not yet completed the authentication stage of the handshake.</p> <p>Early data has weaker security properties than other data sent over an SSL/TLS connection. In particular the data does not have forward secrecy. There are also additional considerations around replay attacks (see \"REPLAY PROTECTION\" below). For these reasons extreme care should be exercised when using early data. For specific details, consult the TLS 1.3 specification.</p> <p>When a server receives early data it may opt to immediately respond by sending application data back to the client. Data sent by the server at this stage is done before the full handshake has been completed. Specifically the client's authentication messages have not yet been received, i.e. the client is unauthenticated at this point and care should be taken when using this capability.</p> <p>A server or client can determine whether the full handshake has been completed or not by calling SSL_is_init_finished(3).</p> <p>On the client side, the function SSL_SESSION_get_max_early_data() can be used to determine if a session established with a server can be used to send early data. If the session cannot be used then this function will return 0. Otherwise it will return the maximum number of early data bytes that can be sent.</p> <p>The function SSL_SESSION_set_max_early_data() sets the maximum number of early data bytes that can be sent for a session. This would typically be used when creating a PSK session file (see SSL_CTX_set_psk_use_session_callback(3)). If using a ticket based PSK then this is set automatically to the value provided by the server.</p> <p>A client uses the function SSL_write_early_data() to send early data. This function is similar to the SSL_write_ex(3) function, but with the following differences. See SSL_write_ex(3) for information on how to write bytes to the underlying connection, and how to handle any errors that may arise. This page describes the differences between SSL_write_early_data() and SSL_write_ex(3).</p> <p>When called by a client, SSL_write_early_data() must be the first IO function called on a new connection, i.e. it must occur before any calls to SSL_write_ex(3), SSL_read_ex(3), SSL_connect(3), SSL_do_handshake(3) or other similar functions. It may be called multiple times to stream data to the server, but the total number of bytes written must not exceed the value returned from SSL_SESSION_get_max_early_data(). Once the initial SSL_write_early_data() call has completed successfully the client may interleave calls to SSL_read_ex(3) and SSL_read(3) with calls to SSL_write_early_data() as required.</p> <p>If SSL_write_early_data() fails you should call SSL_get_error(3) to determine the correct course of action, as for SSL_write_ex(3).</p> <p>When the client no longer wishes to send any more early data then it should complete the handshake by calling a function such as SSL_connect(3) or SSL_do_handshake(3). Alternatively you can call a standard write function such as SSL_write_ex(3), which will transparently complete the connection and write the requested data.</p> <p>A server may choose to ignore early data that has been sent to it. Once the connection has been completed you can determine whether the server accepted or rejected the early data by calling SSL_get_early_data_status(). This will return SSL_EARLY_DATA_ACCEPTED if the data was accepted, SSL_EARLY_DATA_REJECTED if it was rejected or SSL_EARLY_DATA_NOT_SENT if no early data was sent. This function may be called by either the client or the server.</p> <p>A server uses the SSL_read_early_data() function to receive early data on a connection for which early data has been enabled using SSL_CTX_set_max_early_data() or SSL_set_max_early_data(). As for SSL_write_early_data(), this must be the first IO function called on a connection, i.e. it must occur before any calls to SSL_write_ex(3), SSL_read_ex(3), SSL_accept(3), SSL_do_handshake(3), or other similar functions.</p> <p>SSL_read_early_data() is similar to SSL_read_ex(3) with the following differences. Refer to SSL_read_ex(3) for full details.</p> <p>SSL_read_early_data() may return 3 possible values:</p> <ul> <li> <p>SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_ERROR</p> <p>This indicates an IO or some other error occurred. This should be treated in the same way as a 0 return value from SSL_read_ex(3).</p> </li> <li> <p>SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_SUCCESS</p> <p>This indicates that early data was successfully read. This should be treated in the same way as a 1 return value from SSL_read_ex(3). You should continue to call SSL_read_early_data() to read more data.</p> </li> <li> <p>SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH</p> <p>This indicates that no more early data can be read. It may be returned on the first call to SSL_read_early_data() if the client has not sent any early data, or if the early data was rejected.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Once the initial SSL_read_early_data() call has completed successfully (i.e. it has returned SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_SUCCESS or SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH) then the server may choose to write data immediately to the unauthenticated client using SSL_write_early_data(). If SSL_read_early_data() returned SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH then in some situations (e.g. if the client only supports TLSv1.2) the handshake may have already been completed and calls to SSL_write_early_data() are not allowed. Call SSL_is_init_finished(3) to determine whether the handshake has completed or not. If the handshake is still in progress then the server may interleave calls to SSL_write_early_data() with calls to SSL_read_early_data() as required.</p> <p>Servers must not call SSL_read_ex(3), SSL_read(3), SSL_write_ex(3) or SSL_write(3)  until SSL_read_early_data() has returned with SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH. Once it has done so the connection to the client still needs to be completed. Complete the connection by calling a function such as SSL_accept(3) or SSL_do_handshake(3). Alternatively you can call a standard read function such as SSL_read_ex(3), which will transparently complete the connection and read the requested data. Note that it is an error to attempt to complete the connection before SSL_read_early_data() has returned SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH.</p> <p>Only servers may call SSL_read_early_data().</p> <p>Calls to SSL_read_early_data() may, in certain circumstances, complete the connection immediately without further need to call a function such as SSL_accept(3). This can happen if the client is using a protocol version less than TLSv1.3. Applications can test for this by calling SSL_is_init_finished(3). Alternatively, applications may choose to call SSL_accept(3) anyway. Such a call will successfully return immediately with no further action taken.</p> <p>When a session is created between a server and a client the server will specify the maximum amount of any early data that it will accept on any future connection attempt. By default the server does not accept early data; a server may indicate support for early data by calling SSL_CTX_set_max_early_data() or SSL_set_max_early_data() to set it for the whole SSL_CTX or an individual SSL object respectively. The max_early_data parameter specifies the maximum amount of early data in bytes that is permitted to be sent on a single connection. Similarly the SSL_CTX_get_max_early_data() and SSL_get_max_early_data() functions can be used to obtain the current maximum early data settings for the SSL_CTX and SSL objects respectively. Generally a server application will either use both of SSL_read_early_data() and SSL_CTX_set_max_early_data() (or SSL_set_max_early_data()), or neither of them, since there is no practical benefit from using only one of them. If the maximum early data setting for a server is nonzero then replay protection is automatically enabled (see \"REPLAY PROTECTION\" below).</p> <p>If the server rejects the early data sent by a client then it will skip over the data that is sent. The maximum amount of received early data that is skipped is controlled by the recv_max_early_data setting. If a client sends more than this then the connection will abort. This value can be set by calling SSL_CTX_set_recv_max_early_data() or SSL_set_recv_max_early_data(). The current value for this setting can be obtained by calling SSL_CTX_get_recv_max_early_data() or SSL_get_recv_max_early_data(). The default value for this setting is 16,384 bytes.</p> <p>The recv_max_early_data value also has an impact on early data that is accepted. The amount of data that is accepted will always be the lower of the max_early_data for the session and the recv_max_early_data setting for the server. If a client sends more data than this then the connection will abort.</p> <p>The configured value for max_early_data on a server may change over time as required. However, clients may have tickets containing the previously configured max_early_data value. The recv_max_early_data should always be equal to or higher than any recently configured max_early_data value in order to avoid aborted connections. The recv_max_early_data should never be set to less than the current configured max_early_data value.</p> <p>Some server applications may wish to have more control over whether early data is accepted or not, for example to mitigate replay risks (see \"REPLAY PROTECTION\" below) or to decline early_data when the server is heavily loaded. The functions SSL_CTX_set_allow_early_data_cb() and SSL_set_allow_early_data_cb() set a callback which is called at a point in the handshake immediately before a decision is made to accept or reject early data. The callback is provided with a pointer to the user data argument that was provided when the callback was first set. Returning 1 from the callback will allow early data and returning 0 will reject it. Note that the OpenSSL library may reject early data for other reasons in which case this callback will not get called. Notably, the built-in replay protection feature will still be used even if a callback is present unless it has been explicitly disabled using the SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY option. See \"REPLAY PROTECTION\" below.</p>"},{"location":"man3/SSL_read_early_data/#notes","title":"NOTES","text":"<p>The whole purpose of early data is to enable a client to start sending data to the server before a full round trip of network traffic has occurred. Application developers should ensure they consider optimisation of the underlying TCP socket to obtain a performant solution. For example Nagle's algorithm is commonly used by operating systems in an attempt to avoid lots of small TCP packets. In many scenarios this is beneficial for performance, but it does not work well with the early data solution as implemented in OpenSSL. In Nagle's algorithm the OS will buffer outgoing TCP data if a TCP packet has already been sent which we have not yet received an ACK for from the peer. The buffered data will only be transmitted if enough data to fill an entire TCP packet is accumulated, or if the ACK is received from the peer. The initial ClientHello will be sent in the first TCP packet along with any data from the first call to SSL_write_early_data(). If the amount of data written will exceed the size of a single TCP packet, or if there are more calls to SSL_write_early_data() then that additional data will be sent in subsequent TCP packets which will be buffered by the OS and not sent until an ACK is received for the first packet containing the ClientHello. This means the early data is not actually sent until a complete round trip with the server has occurred which defeats the objective of early data.</p> <p>In many operating systems the TCP_NODELAY socket option is available to disable Nagle's algorithm. If an application opts to disable Nagle's algorithm consideration should be given to turning it back on again after the handshake is complete if appropriate.</p> <p>In rare circumstances, it may be possible for a client to have a session that reports a max early data value greater than 0, but where the server does not support this. For example, this can occur if a server has had its configuration changed to accept a lower max early data value such as by calling SSL_CTX_set_recv_max_early_data(). Another example is if a server used to support TLSv1.3 but was later downgraded to TLSv1.2. Sending early data to such a server will cause the connection to abort. Clients that encounter an aborted connection while sending early data may want to retry the connection without sending early data as this does not happen automatically. A client will have to establish a new transport layer connection to the server and attempt the SSL/TLS connection again but without sending early data. Note that it is inadvisable to retry with a lower maximum protocol version.</p>"},{"location":"man3/SSL_read_early_data/#replay-protection","title":"REPLAY PROTECTION","text":"<p>When early data is in use the TLS protocol provides no security guarantees that the same early data was not replayed across multiple connections. As a mitigation for this issue OpenSSL automatically enables replay protection if the server is configured with a nonzero max early data value. With replay protection enabled sessions are forced to be single use only. If a client attempts to reuse a session ticket more than once, then the second and subsequent attempts will fall back to a full handshake (and any early data that was submitted will be ignored). Note that single use tickets are enforced even if a client does not send any early data.</p> <p>The replay protection mechanism relies on the internal OpenSSL server session cache (see SSL_CTX_set_session_cache_mode(3)). When replay protection is being used the server will operate as if the SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option had been selected (see SSL_CTX_set_options(3)). Sessions will be added to the cache whenever a session ticket is issued. When a client attempts to resume the session, OpenSSL will check for its presence in the internal cache. If it exists then the resumption is allowed and the session is removed from the cache. If it does not exist then the resumption is not allowed and a full handshake will occur.</p> <p>Note that some applications may maintain an external cache of sessions (see SSL_CTX_sess_set_new_cb(3) and similar functions). It is the application's responsibility to ensure that any sessions in the external cache are also populated in the internal cache and that once removed from the internal cache they are similarly removed from the external cache. Failing to do this could result in an application becoming vulnerable to replay attacks. Note that OpenSSL will lock the internal cache while a session is removed but that lock is not held when the remove session callback (see SSL_CTX_sess_set_remove_cb(3)) is called. This could result in a small amount of time where the session has been removed from the internal cache but is still available in the external cache. Applications should be designed with this in mind in order to minimise the possibility of replay attacks.</p> <p>The OpenSSL replay protection does not apply to external Pre Shared Keys (PSKs) (e.g. see SSL_CTX_set_psk_find_session_callback(3)). Therefore, extreme caution should be applied when combining external PSKs with early data.</p> <p>Some applications may mitigate the replay risks in other ways. For those applications it is possible to turn off the built-in replay protection feature using the SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY option. See SSL_CTX_set_options(3) for details.

Through user-written methods (see UI_create_method(3)), prompting can be done in any way imaginable, be it plain text prompting, through dialog boxes or from a cell phone.</p> <p>All the functions work through a context of the type UI.  This context contains all the information needed to prompt correctly as well as a reference to a UI_METHOD, which is an ordered vector of functions that carry out the actual prompting.</p> <p>The first thing to do is to create a UI with UI_new() or UI_new_method(), then add information to it with the UI_add or UI_dup functions.  Also, user-defined random data can be passed down to the underlying method through calls to UI_add_user_data() or UI_dup_user_data().  The default UI method doesn't care about these data, but other methods might.  Finally, use UI_process() to actually perform the prompting and UI_get0_result() and UI_get_result_length() to find the result to the prompt and its length.</p> <p>A UI can contain more than one prompt, which are performed in the given sequence.  Each prompt gets an index number which is returned by the UI_add and UI_dup functions, and has to be used to get the corresponding result with UI_get0_result() and UI_get_result_length().</p> <p>UI_process() can be called more than once on the same UI, thereby allowing a UI to have a long lifetime, but can just as well have a short lifetime.</p> <p>The functions are as follows:</p> <p>UI_new() creates a new UI using the default UI method.  When done with this UI, it should be freed using UI_free().</p> <p>UI_new_method() creates a new UI using the given UI method.  When done with this UI, it should be freed using UI_free().</p> <p>UI_OpenSSL() returns the built-in UI method (note: not necessarily the default one, since the default can be changed.  See further on).  This method is the most machine/OS dependent part of OpenSSL and normally generates the most problems when porting.</p> <p>UI_null() returns a UI method that does nothing.  Its use is to avoid getting internal defaults for passed UI_METHOD pointers.</p> <p>UI_free() removes a UI from memory, along with all other pieces of memory that's connected to it, like duplicated input strings, results and others. If ui is NULL nothing is done.</p> <p>UI_add_input_string() and UI_add_verify_string() add a prompt to the UI, as well as flags and a result buffer and the desired minimum and maximum sizes of the result, not counting the final NUL character.  The given information is used to prompt for information, for example a password, and to verify a password (i.e. having the user enter it twice and check that the same string was entered twice).  UI_add_verify_string() takes and extra argument that should be a pointer to the result buffer of the input string that it's supposed to verify, or verification will fail.</p> <p>UI_add_input_boolean() adds a prompt to the UI that's supposed to be answered in a boolean way, with a single character for yes and a different character for no.  A set of characters that can be used to cancel the prompt is given as well.  The prompt itself is divided in two, one part being the descriptive text (given through the prompt argument) and one describing the possible answers (given through the action_desc argument).</p> <p>UI_add_info_string() and UI_add_error_string() add strings that are shown at the same time as the prompt for extra information or to show an error string. The difference between the two is only conceptual.  With the builtin method, there's no technical difference between them.  Other methods may make a difference between them, however.</p> <p>The flags currently supported are UI_INPUT_FLAG_ECHO, which is relevant for UI_add_input_string() and will have the users response be echoed (when prompting for a password, this flag should obviously not be used, and UI_INPUT_FLAG_DEFAULT_PWD, which means that a default password of some sort will be used (completely depending on the application and the UI method).</p> <p>UI_dup_input_string(), UI_dup_verify_string(), UI_dup_input_boolean(), UI_dup_info_string() and UI_dup_error_string() are basically the same as their UI_add counterparts, except that they make their own copies of all strings.</p> <p>UI_construct_prompt() is a helper function that can be used to create a prompt from two pieces of information: an description and a name. The default constructor (if there is none provided by the method used) creates a string \"Enter description for name:\".  With the description \"pass phrase\" and the filename \"foo.key\", that becomes \"Enter pass phrase for foo.key:\".  Other methods may create whatever string and may include encodings that will be processed by the other method functions.</p> <p>UI_add_user_data() adds a user data pointer for the method to use at any time.  The builtin UI method doesn't care about this info.  Note that several calls to this function doesn't add data, it replaces the previous blob with the one given as argument.</p> <p>UI_dup_user_data() duplicates the user data and works as an alternative to UI_add_user_data() when the user data needs to be preserved for a longer duration, perhaps even the lifetime of the application.  The UI object takes ownership of this duplicate and will free it whenever it gets replaced or the UI is destroyed.  UI_dup_user_data() returns 0 on success, or -1 on memory allocation failure or if the method doesn't have a duplicator function.</p> <p>UI_get0_user_data() retrieves the data that has last been given to the UI with UI_add_user_data() or UI_dup_user_data.</p> <p>UI_get0_result() returns a pointer to the result buffer associated with the information indexed by i.</p> <p>UI_get_result_length() returns the length of the result buffer associated with the information indexed by i.</p> <p>UI_process() goes through the information given so far, does all the printing and prompting and returns the final status, which is -2 on out-of-band events (Interrupt, Cancel, ...), -1 on error and 0 on success.</p> <p>UI_ctrl() adds extra control for the application author.  For now, it understands two commands: UI_CTRL_PRINT_ERRORS, which makes UI_process() print the OpenSSL error stack as part of processing the UI, and UI_CTRL_IS_REDOABLE, which returns a flag saying if the used UI can be used again or not.</p> <p>UI_set_default_method() changes the default UI method to the one given. This function is not thread-safe and should not be called at the same time as other OpenSSL functions.</p> <p>UI_get_default_method() returns a pointer to the current default UI method.</p> <p>UI_get_method() returns the UI method associated with a given UI.</p> <p>UI_set_method() changes the UI method associated with a given UI.</p>"},{"location":"man3/UI_new/#notes","title":"NOTES","text":"<p>The resulting strings that the built in method UI_OpenSSL() generate are assumed to be encoded according to the current locale or (for Windows) code page.

If ctx is NULL nothing is done.</p> <p>X509_STORE_CTX_init() sets up ctx for a subsequent verification operation. It must be called before each call to X509_verify_cert(), i.e. a ctx is only good for one call to X509_verify_cert(); if you want to verify a second certificate with the same ctx then you must call X509_STORE_CTX_cleanup() and then X509_STORE_CTX_init() again before the second call to X509_verify_cert(). The trusted certificate store is set to store, the end entity certificate to be verified is set to x509 and a set of additional certificates (which will be untrusted but may be used to build the chain) in chain. Any or all of the store, x509 and chain parameters can be NULL.</p> <p>X509_STORE_CTX_set0_trusted_stack() sets the set of trusted certificates of ctx to sk. This is an alternative way of specifying trusted certificates instead of using an X509_STORE.</p> <p>X509_STORE_CTX_set_cert() sets the certificate to be verified in ctx to x.</p> <p>X509_STORE_CTX_set0_verified_chain() sets the validated chain used by ctx to be chain. Ownership of the chain is transferred to ctx and should not be free'd by the caller. X509_STORE_CTX_get0_chain() returns the internal pointer used by the ctx that contains the validated chain.</p> <p>X509_STORE_CTX_set0_crls() sets a set of CRLs to use to aid certificate verification to sk. These CRLs will only be used if CRL verification is enabled in the associated X509_VERIFY_PARAM structure. This might be used where additional \"useful\" CRLs are supplied as part of a protocol, for example in a PKCS#7 structure.</p> <p>X509_STORE_CTX_get0_param() retrieves an internal pointer to the verification parameters associated with ctx.</p> <p>X509_STORE_CTX_get0_untrusted() retrieves an internal pointer to the stack of untrusted certificates associated with ctx.</p> <p>X509_STORE_CTX_set0_untrusted() sets the internal point to the stack of untrusted certificates associated with ctx to sk.</p> <p>X509_STORE_CTX_set0_param() sets the internal verification parameter pointer to param. After this call param should not be used.</p> <p>X509_STORE_CTX_set_default() looks up and sets the default verification method to name. This uses the function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_lookup() to find an appropriate set of parameters from name.</p> <p>X509_STORE_CTX_get_num_untrusted() returns the number of untrusted certificates that were used in building the chain following a call to X509_verify_cert().</p> <p>X509_STORE_CTX_set_verify() provides the capability for overriding the default verify function. This function is responsible for verifying chain signatures and expiration times.</p> <p>A verify function is defined as an X509_STORE_CTX_verify type which has the following signature:</p> <pre><code>int (*verify)(X509_STORE_CTX *);\n</code></pre> <p>This function should receive the current X509_STORE_CTX as a parameter and return 1 on success or 0 on failure.</p> <p>X509 certificates may contain information about what purposes keys contained within them can be used for. For example \"TLS WWW Server Authentication\" or \"Email Protection\". This \"key usage\" information is held internally to the certificate itself. In addition the trust store containing trusted certificates can declare what purposes we trust different certificates for. This \"trust\" information is not held within the certificate itself but is \"meta\" information held alongside it. This \"meta\" information is associated with the certificate after it is issued and could be determined by a system administrator. For example a certificate might declare that it is suitable for use for both \"TLS WWW Server Authentication\" and \"TLS Client Authentication\", but a system administrator might only trust it for the former. An X.509 certificate extension exists that can record extended key usage information to supplement the purpose information described above. This extended mechanism is arbitrarily extensible and not well suited for a generic library API; applications that need to validate extended key usage information in certifiates will need to define a custom \"purpose\" (see below) or supply a nondefault verification callback (X509_STORE_set_verify_cb_func(3)).</p> <p>X509_STORE_CTX_set_purpose() sets the purpose for the target certificate being verified in the ctx. Built-in available values for the purpose argument are X509_PURPOSE_SSL_CLIENT, X509_PURPOSE_SSL_SERVER, X509_PURPOSE_NS_SSL_SERVER, X509_PURPOSE_SMIME_SIGN, X509_PURPOSE_SMIME_ENCRYPT, X509_PURPOSE_CRL_SIGN, X509_PURPOSE_ANY, X509_PURPOSE_OCSP_HELPER and X509_PURPOSE_TIMESTAMP_SIGN. It is also possible to create a custom purpose value. Setting a purpose will ensure that the key usage declared within certificates in the chain being verified is consistent with that purpose as well as, potentially, other checks. Every purpose also has an associated default trust value which will also be set at the same time. During verification this trust setting will be verified to check it is consistent with the trust set by the system administrator for certificates in the chain.</p> <p>X509_STORE_CTX_set_trust() sets the trust value for the target certificate being verified in the ctx. Built-in available values for the trust argument are X509_TRUST_COMPAT, X509_TRUST_SSL_CLIENT, X509_TRUST_SSL_SERVER, X509_TRUST_EMAIL, X509_TRUST_OBJECT_SIGN, X509_TRUST_OCSP_SIGN, X509_TRUST_OCSP_REQUEST and X509_TRUST_TSA. It is also possible to create a custom trust value. Since X509_STORE_CTX_set_purpose() also sets the trust value it is normally sufficient to only call that function. If both are called then X509_STORE_CTX_set_trust() should be called after X509_STORE_CTX_set_purpose() since the trust setting of the last call will be used.</p> <p>It should not normally be necessary for end user applications to call X509_STORE_CTX_purpose_inherit() directly. Typically applications should call X509_STORE_CTX_set_purpose() or X509_STORE_CTX_set_trust() instead. Using this function it is possible to set the purpose and trust values for the ctx at the same time. Both ctx and its internal verification parameter pointer must not be NULL. The def_purpose and purpose arguments can have the same purpose values as described for X509_STORE_CTX_set_purpose() above. The trust argument can have the same trust values as described in X509_STORE_CTX_set_trust() above. Any of the def_purpose, purpose or trust values may also have the value 0 to indicate that the supplied parameter should be ignored. After calling this function the purpose to be used for verification is set from the purpose argument unless the purpose was already set in ctx before, and the trust is set from the trust argument unless the trust was already set in ctx before. If trust is 0 then the trust value will be set from the default trust value for purpose. If the default trust value for the purpose is X509_TRUST_DEFAULT and trust is 0 then the default trust value associated with the def_purpose value is used for the trust setting instead.</p>"},{"location":"man3/X509_STORE_CTX_new/#notes","title":"NOTES","text":"<p>The certificates and CRLs in a store are used internally and should not be freed up until after the associated X509_STORE_CTX is freed.</p>"},{"location":"man3/X509_STORE_CTX_new/#bugs","title":"BUGS","text":"<p>The certificates and CRLs in a context are used internally and should not be freed up until after the associated X509_STORE_CTX is freed.

It admits multiple lookup mechanisms and efficient scaling performance with large numbers of certificates, and a great deal of flexibility in how validation and policy checks are performed.</p> <p>X509_STORE_new(3) creates an empty X509_STORE structure, which contains no information about trusted certificates or where such certificates are located on disk, and is generally not usable.  Normally, trusted certificates will be added to the X509_STORE to prepare it for use, via mechanisms such as X509_STORE_add_lookup() and X509_LOOKUP_file(), or PEM_read_bio_X509_AUX() and X509_STORE_add_cert().  CRLs can also be added, and many behaviors configured as desired.</p> <p>Once the X509_STORE is suitably configured, X509_STORE_CTX_new() is used to instantiate a single-use X509_STORE_CTX for each chain-building and verification operation.  That process includes providing the end-entity certificate to be verified and an additional set of untrusted certificates that may be used in chain-building.  As such, it is expected that the certificates included in the X509_STORE are certificates that represent trusted entities such as root certificate authorities (CAs). OpenSSL represents these trusted certificates internally as X509 objects with an associated X509_CERT_AUX, as are produced by PEM_read_bio_X509_AUX() and similar routines that refer to X509_AUX. The public interfaces that operate on such trusted certificates still operate on pointers to X509 objects, though.</p> <p>X509_STORE_add_cert() and X509_STORE_add_crl() add the respective object to the X509_STORE's local storage.  Untrusted objects should not be added in this way.  The added object's reference count is incremented by one, hence the caller retains ownership of the object and needs to free it when it is no longer needed.</p> <p>X509_STORE_set_depth(), X509_STORE_set_flags(), X509_STORE_set_purpose(), X509_STORE_set_trust(), and X509_STORE_set1_param() set the default values for the corresponding values used in certificate chain validation.  Their behavior is documented in the corresponding X509_VERIFY_PARAM manual pages, e.g., X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_depth(3).</p> <p>X509_STORE_add_lookup() finds or creates a X509_LOOKUP(3) with the X509_LOOKUP_METHOD(3) meth and adds it to the X509_STORE store.  This also associates the X509_STORE with the lookup, so X509_LOOKUP functions can look up objects in that store.</p> <p>X509_STORE_load_locations() loads trusted certificate(s) into an X509_STORE from a given file and/or directory path.  It is permitted to specify just a file, just a directory, or both paths.  The certificates in the directory must be in hashed form, as documented in X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir(3).</p> <p>X509_STORE_set_default_paths() is somewhat misnamed, in that it does not set what default paths should be used for loading certificates.  Instead, it loads certificates into the X509_STORE from the hardcoded default paths.</p>"},{"location":"man3/X509_STORE_add_cert/#return-values","title":"RETURN VALUES","text":"<p>X509_STORE_add_cert(), X509_STORE_add_crl(), X509_STORE_set_depth(), X509_STORE_set_flags(), X509_STORE_set_purpose(), X509_STORE_set_trust(), X509_STORE_load_locations(), and X509_STORE_set_default_paths() return 1 on success or 0 on failure.</p> <p>X509_STORE_add_lookup() returns the found or created X509_LOOKUP(3), or NULL on error.</p>"},{"location":"man3/X509_STORE_add_cert/#see-also","title":"SEE ALSO","text":"<p>X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir(3).

See the VERIFICATION FLAGS section for a complete description of values the flags parameter can take.</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get_flags() returns the flags in param.</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get_inh_flags() returns the inheritance flags in param which specifies how verification flags are copied from one structure to another. X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_inh_flags() sets the inheritance flags. See the INHERITANCE FLAGS section for a description of these bits.</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_clear_flags() clears the flags flags in param.</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_purpose() sets the verification purpose in param to purpose. This determines the acceptable purpose of the certificate chain, for example SSL client or SSL server.</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_trust() sets the trust setting in param to trust.</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_time() sets the verification time in param to t. Normally the current time is used.</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() adds policy to the acceptable policy set. Contrary to preexisting documentation of this function it does not enable policy checking.</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() enables policy checking (it is disabled by default) and sets the acceptable policy set to policies. Any existing policy set is cleared. The policies parameter can be NULL to clear an existing policy set.</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_depth() sets the maximum verification depth to depth. That is the maximum number of intermediate CA certificates that can appear in a chain. A maximal depth chain contains 2 more certificates than the limit, since neither the end-entity certificate nor the trust-anchor count against this limit. Thus a depth limit of 0 only allows the end-entity certificate to be signed directly by the trust-anchor, while with a depth limit of 1 there can be one intermediate CA certificate between the trust-anchor and the end-entity certificate.</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_auth_level() sets the authentication security level to auth_level. The authentication security level determines the acceptable signature and public key strength when verifying certificate chains. For a certificate chain to validate, the public keys of all the certificates must meet the specified security level. The signature algorithm security level is not enforced for the chain's trust anchor certificate, which is either directly trusted or validated by means other than its signature. See SSL_CTX_set_security_level(3) for the definitions of the available levels. The default security level is -1, or \"not set\". At security level 0 or lower all algorithms are acceptable. Security level 1 requires at least 80-bit-equivalent security and is broadly interoperable, though it will, for example, reject MD5 signatures or RSA keys shorter than 1024 bits.</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host() sets the expected DNS hostname to name clearing any previously specified hostname or names.  If name is NULL, or empty the list of hostnames is cleared, and name checks are not performed on the peer certificate.  If name is NUL-terminated, namelen may be zero, otherwise namelen must be set to the length of name.</p> <p>When a hostname is specified, certificate verification automatically invokes X509_check_host(3) with flags equal to the flags argument given to X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_hostflags() (default zero).  Applications are strongly advised to use this interface in preference to explicitly calling X509_check_host(3), hostname checks may be out of scope with the DANE-EE(3) certificate usage, and the internal check will be suppressed as appropriate when DANE verification is enabled.</p> <p>When the subject CommonName will not be ignored, whether as a result of the X509_CHECK_FLAG_ALWAYS_CHECK_SUBJECT host flag, or because no DNS subject alternative names are present in the certificate, any DNS name constraints in issuer certificates apply to the subject CommonName as well as the subject alternative name extension.</p> <p>When the subject CommonName will be ignored, whether as a result of the X509_CHECK_FLAG_NEVER_CHECK_SUBJECT host flag, or because some DNS subject alternative names are present in the certificate, DNS name constraints in issuer certificates will not be applied to the subject DN. As described in X509_check_host(3) the X509_CHECK_FLAG_NEVER_CHECK_SUBJECT flag takes precedence over the X509_CHECK_FLAG_ALWAYS_CHECK_SUBJECT flag.</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get_hostflags() returns any host flags previously set via a call to X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_hostflags().</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add1_host() adds name as an additional reference identifier that can match the peer's certificate.  Any previous names set via X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host() or X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add1_host() are retained, no change is made if name is NULL or empty.  When multiple names are configured, the peer is considered verified when any name matches.</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get0_peername() returns the DNS hostname or subject CommonName from the peer certificate that matched one of the reference identifiers.  When wildcard matching is not disabled, or when a reference identifier specifies a parent domain (starts with \".\") rather than a hostname, the peer name may be a wildcard name or a sub-domain of the reference identifier respectively.  The return string is allocated by the library and is no longer valid once the associated param argument is freed.  Applications must not free the return value.</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_email() sets the expected RFC822 email address to email.  If email is NUL-terminated, emaillen may be zero, otherwise emaillen must be set to the length of email.  When an email address is specified, certificate verification automatically invokes X509_check_email(3).</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_ip() sets the expected IP address to ip. The ip argument is in binary format, in network byte-order and iplen must be set to 4 for IPv4 and 16 for IPv6.  When an IP address is specified, certificate verification automatically invokes X509_check_ip(3).</p> <p>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_ip_asc() sets the expected IP address to ipasc.  The ipasc argument is a NUL-terminal ASCII string: dotted decimal quad for IPv4 and colon-separated hexadecimal for IPv6.

By default any unhandled critical extensions in certificates or (if checked) CRLs results in a fatal error. If this flag is set unhandled critical extensions are ignored. WARNING setting this option for anything other than debugging purposes can be a security risk. Finer control over which extensions are supported can be performed in the verification callback.</p> <p>The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag disables workarounds for some broken certificates and makes the verification strictly apply X509 rules.</p> <p>X509_V_FLAG_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS enables proxy certificate verification.</p> <p>X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK enables certificate policy checking, by default no policy checking is performed.

If X509_V_FLAG_EXTENDED_CRL_SUPPORT is set they are enabled.</p> <p>If X509_V_FLAG_USE_DELTAS is set delta CRLs (if present) are used to determine certificate status. If not set deltas are ignored.</p> <p>X509_V_FLAG_CHECK_SS_SIGNATURE requests checking the signature of the last certificate in a chain if the certificate is supposedly self-signed. This is prohibited and will result in an error if it is a non-conforming CA certificate with key usage restrictions not including the keyCertSign bit. By default this check is disabled because it doesn't add any additional security but in some cases applications might want to check the signature anyway. A side effect of not checking the self-signature of such a certificate is that disabled or unsupported message digests used for the signature are not treated as fatal errors.</p> <p>When X509_V_FLAG_TRUSTED_FIRST is set, construction of the certificate chain in X509_verify_cert(3) will search the trust store for issuer certificates before searching the provided untrusted certificates. Local issuer certificates are often more likely to satisfy local security requirements and lead to a locally trusted root. This is especially important when some certificates in the trust store have explicit trust settings (see \"TRUST SETTINGS\" in x509(1)). As of OpenSSL 1.1.0 this option is on by default.</p> <p>The X509_V_FLAG_NO_ALT_CHAINS flag suppresses checking for alternative chains. By default, unless X509_V_FLAG_TRUSTED_FIRST is set, when building a certificate chain, if the first certificate chain found is not trusted, then OpenSSL will attempt to replace untrusted certificates supplied by the peer with certificates from the trust store to see if an alternative chain can be found that is trusted. As of OpenSSL 1.1.0, with X509_V_FLAG_TRUSTED_FIRST always set, this option has no effect.</p> <p>The X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN flag causes intermediate certificates in the trust store to be treated as trust-anchors, in the same way as the self-signed root CA certificates. This makes it possible to trust certificates issued by an intermediate CA without having to trust its ancestor root CA. With OpenSSL 1.1.0 and later and  set, chain construction stops as soon as the first certificate from the trust store is added to the chain, whether that certificate is a self-signed \"root\" certificate or a not self-signed intermediate certificate. Thus, when an intermediate certificate is found in the trust store, the verified chain passed to callbacks may be shorter than it otherwise would be without the X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN flag. <p>The X509_V_FLAG_NO_CHECK_TIME flag suppresses checking the validity period of certificates and CRLs against the current time.

For example, by default, the host name \"www.example.com\" would match a certificate with a SAN or CN value of \"*.example.com\", \"w*.example.com\" or \"*w.example.com\".</p> <p>Per section 6.4.2 of RFC 6125, name values representing international domain names must be given in A-label form.  The namelen argument must be the number of characters in the name string or zero in which case the length is calculated with strlen(name).  When name starts with a dot (e.g. \".example.com\"), it will be matched by a certificate valid for any sub-domain of name, (see also X509_CHECK_FLAG_SINGLE_LABEL_SUBDOMAINS below).</p> <p>When the certificate is matched, and peername is not NULL, a pointer to a copy of the matching SAN or CN from the peer certificate is stored at the address passed in peername.  The application is responsible for freeing the peername via OPENSSL_free() when it is no longer needed.</p> <p>X509_check_email() checks if the certificate matches the specified email address.  Only the mailbox syntax of RFC 822 is supported, comments are not allowed, and no attempt is made to normalize quoted characters.  The addresslen argument must be the number of characters in the address string or zero in which case the length is calculated with strlen(address).</p> <p>X509_check_ip() checks if the certificate matches a specified IPv4 or IPv6 address.  The address array is in binary format, in network byte order.  The length is either 4 (IPv4) or 16 (IPv6).  Only explicitly marked addresses in the certificates are considered; IP addresses stored in DNS names and Common Names are ignored.</p> <p>X509_check_ip_asc() is similar, except that the NUL-terminated string address is first converted to the internal representation.</p> <p>The flags argument is usually 0.  It can be the bitwise OR of the flags:</p> <ul> <li>X509_CHECK_FLAG_ALWAYS_CHECK_SUBJECT,</li> <li>X509_CHECK_FLAG_NEVER_CHECK_SUBJECT,</li> <li>X509_CHECK_FLAG_NO_WILDCARDS,</li> <li>X509_CHECK_FLAG_NO_PARTIAL_WILDCARDS,</li> <li>X509_CHECK_FLAG_MULTI_LABEL_WILDCARDS.</li> <li>X509_CHECK_FLAG_SINGLE_LABEL_SUBDOMAINS.</li> </ul> <p>The X509_CHECK_FLAG_ALWAYS_CHECK_SUBJECT flag causes the function to consider the subject DN even if the certificate contains at least one subject alternative name of the right type (DNS name or email address as appropriate); the default is to ignore the subject DN when at least one corresponding subject alternative names is present.</p> <p>The X509_CHECK_FLAG_NEVER_CHECK_SUBJECT flag causes the function to never consider the subject DN even if the certificate contains no subject alternative names of the right type (DNS name or email address as appropriate); the default is to use the subject DN when no corresponding subject alternative names are present. If both X509_CHECK_FLAG_ALWAYS_CHECK_SUBJECT and X509_CHECK_FLAG_NEVER_CHECK_SUBJECT are specified, the latter takes precedence and the subject DN is not checked for matching names.</p> <p>If set, X509_CHECK_FLAG_NO_WILDCARDS disables wildcard expansion; this only applies to X509_check_host.</p> <p>If set, X509_CHECK_FLAG_NO_PARTIAL_WILDCARDS suppresses support for \"*\" as wildcard pattern in labels that have a prefix or suffix, such as: \"www*\" or \"*www\"; this only applies to X509_check_host.</p> <p>If set, X509_CHECK_FLAG_MULTI_LABEL_WILDCARDS allows a \"*\" that constitutes the complete label of a DNS name (e.g. \"*.example.com\") to match more than one label in name; this flag only applies to X509_check_host.</p> <p>If set, X509_CHECK_FLAG_SINGLE_LABEL_SUBDOMAINS restricts name values which start with \".\", that would otherwise match any sub-domain in the peer certificate, to only match direct child sub-domains. Thus, for instance, with this flag set a name of \".example.com\" would match a peer certificate with a DNS name of \"www.example.com\", but would not match a peer certificate with a DNS name of \"www.sub.example.com\"; this flag only applies to X509_check_host.</p>"},{"location":"man3/X509_check_host/#return-values","title":"RETURN VALUES","text":"<p>The functions return 1 for a successful match, 0 for a failed match and -1 for an internal error: typically a memory allocation failure or an ASN.1 decoding error.</p> <p>All functions can also return -2 if the input is malformed.

It is used for the OpenSSL master configuration file openssl.cnf and in a few other places like SPKAC files and certificate extension files for the x509 utility. OpenSSL applications can also use the CONF library for their own purposes.</p> <p>A configuration file is divided into a number of sections. Each section starts with a line [ section_name ] and ends when a new section is started or end of file is reached. A section name can consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores.</p> <p>The first section of a configuration file is special and is referred to as the default section. This section is usually unnamed and spans from the start of file until the first named section. When a name is being looked up it is first looked up in a named section (if any) and then the default section.</p> <p>The environment is mapped onto a section called ENV.</p> <p>Comments can be included by preceding them with the # character</p> <p>Other files can be included using the .include directive followed by a path. If the path points to a directory all files with names ending with .cnf or .conf are included from the directory. Recursive inclusion of directories from files in such directory is not supported. That means the files in the included directory can also contain .include directives but only inclusion of regular files is supported there. The inclusion of directories is not supported on systems without POSIX IO support.</p> <p>It is strongly recommended to use absolute paths with the .include directive. Relative paths are evaluated based on the application current working directory so unless the configuration file containing the .include directive is application specific the inclusion will not work as expected.</p> <p>There can be optional = character and whitespace characters between .include directive and the path which can be useful in cases the configuration file needs to be loaded by old OpenSSL versions which do not support the .include syntax. They would bail out with error if the = character is not present but with it they just ignore the include.</p> <p>Each section in a configuration file consists of a number of name and value pairs of the form name=value</p> <p>The name string can contain any alphanumeric characters as well as a few punctuation symbols such as . , ; and _.</p> <p>The value string consists of the string following the = character until end of line with any leading and trailing white space removed.</p> <p>The value string undergoes variable expansion. This can be done by including the form $var or ${var}: this will substitute the value of the named variable in the current section. It is also possible to substitute a value from another section using the syntax $section::name or ${section::name}. By using the form $ENV::name environment variables can be substituted. It is also possible to assign values to environment variables by using the name ENV::name, this will work if the program looks up environment variables using the CONF library instead of calling getenv() directly. The value string must not exceed 64k in length after variable expansion. Otherwise an error will occur.</p> <p>It is possible to escape certain characters by using any kind of quote or the \\ character. By making the last character of a line a \\ a value string can be spread across multiple lines. In addition the sequences \\n, \\r, \\b and \\t are recognized.</p> <p>All expansion and escape rules as described above that apply to value also apply to the path of the .include directive.</p>"},{"location":"man5/config/#openssl-library-configuration","title":"OPENSSL LIBRARY CONFIGURATION","text":"<p>Applications can automatically configure certain aspects of OpenSSL using the master OpenSSL configuration file, or optionally an alternative configuration file.

Software-based generators must be seeded with external randomness before they can be used as a cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG). The availability of common hardware with special instructions and modern operating systems, which may use items such as interrupt jitter and network packet timings, can be reasonable sources of seeding material.</p> <p>OpenSSL comes with a default implementation of the RAND API which is based on the deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) model as described in [NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1]. The default random generator will initialize automatically on first use and will be fully functional without having to be initialized ('seeded') explicitly. It seeds and reseeds itself automatically using trusted random sources provided by the operating system.</p> <p>As a normal application developer, you do not have to worry about any details, just use RAND_bytes(3) to obtain random data. Having said that, there is one important rule to obey: Always check the error return value of RAND_bytes(3) and do not take randomness for granted. Although (re-)seeding is automatic, it can fail because no trusted random source is available or the trusted source(s) temporarily fail to provide sufficient random seed material. In this case the CSPRNG enters an error state and ceases to provide output, until it is able to recover from the error by reseeding itself.

An X.509 CRL (certificate revocation list) is a tool to help determine if a certificate is still valid.  The exact definition of those can be found in the X.509 document from ITU-T, or in RFC3280 from PKIX. In OpenSSL, the type X509 is used to express such a certificate, and the type X509_CRL is used to express a CRL.</p> <p>A related structure is a certificate request, defined in PKCS#10 from RSA Security, Inc, also reflected in RFC2896.  In OpenSSL, the type X509_REQ is used to express such a certificate request.</p> <p>To handle some complex parts of a certificate, there are the types X509_NAME (to express a certificate name), X509_ATTRIBUTE (to express a certificate attribute), X509_EXTENSION (to express a certificate extension) and a few more.</p> <p>Finally, there's the supertype X509_INFO, which can contain a CRL, a certificate and a corresponding private key.</p> <p>X509_XXX, d2i_X509_XXX, and i2d_X509_XXX functions handle X.509 certificates, with some exceptions, shown below.</p> <p>X509_CRL_XXX, d2i_X509_CRL_XXX, and i2d_X509_CRL_XXX functions handle X.509 CRLs.</p> <p>X509_REQ_XXX, d2i_X509_REQ_XXX, and i2d_X509_REQ_XXX functions handle PKCS#10 certificate requests.</p> <p>X509_NAME_XXX functions handle certificate names.</p> <p>X509_ATTRIBUTE_XXX functions handle certificate attributes.</p> <p>X509_EXTENSION_XXX functions handle certificate extensions.</p>"},{"location":"man7/x509/#see-also","title":"SEE ALSO","text":"<p>X509_NAME_ENTRY_get_object(3), X509_NAME_add_entry_by_txt(3), X509_NAME_add_entry_by_NID(3), X509_NAME_print_ex(3), X509_NAME_new(3), d2i_X509(3), d2i_X509_ALGOR(3), d2i_X509_CRL(3), d2i_X509_NAME(3), d2i_X509_REQ(3), d2i_X509_SIG(3), X509v3(3), crypto(7)</p>"},{"location":"man7/x509/#copyright","title":"COPYRIGHT","text":"<p>Copyright 2003-2021 The OpenSSL Project Authors.
